He is the Eleventh Prince of the Holy Britannian Empire and the 98th Emperor of Britannia, Charles zi Britannia.\n\nLelouch is a very clever individual who is also calm, sophisticated, and arrogant due to his aristocratic upbringing. While at school, Lelouch conducts himself as a friendly, likable, and often an easygoing student. However, this is a mask to hide his true nature. While as Zero, his true nature is expressed. His charisma and beliefs in justice gain him the trust and respect of many soldiers and leaders.\n\nHe is known for having a very stoic personality. He never cared about schoolwork, seeing the entire thing as trivial, even though his high intelligence would make it easy for him. He enjoys seeking out challenges, often playing chess against the nobility. In general, Lelouch takes most day-to-day affairs with open disinterest, often not even noticing the affection of others, especially Shirley, his classmate. He has a strong dislike for nobles, viewing them as tepid and \"overprivileged parasites.\"\n\nMany characters have noted that Lelouch is entirely selfish, as his desire to remake the world into what he wants it to become from his desire to avenge his mother's apparent death and Nunnally's sake. However, in time, he realizes that this goal is not just for them but also the entire world.\n\nDespite his cold, calculating demeanor and ruthlessness in battle, he can be a rather compassionate person to his friends and loved ones. To Nunnally, he is a loving older brother, and to Suzaku, a loyal friend, although the two are enemies. Lelouch, at first glance, seems to have relatively little concern for the well-being of his subordinates, but in reality, he does care about them, seeing them as valuable allies.\n\n\nCharacter Background (as Lelouch):\n\nCharacter Background (as Zero):\n\nFirst Season:\n\nSecond Season:\n\n\nGeass:\nLelouch's Geass, bestowed upon him by C.C., gives him \"The Power of Absolute Obedience,\" allowing him to plant commands within a person's mind upon eye contact in a manner comparable to hypnosis. Activation of his Geass is visually represented by the manifestation of a Geass Sigil in his left eye. Commands dictated are written into the minds of the designated targets, the Sigil projecting him from his eye to theirs.\n\nOf all the Geass abilities in the series, Lelouch's has been explored the most and also seems to have the most restrictions, and side effects of any Geass introduced:(Source: Code Geass Wiki, Villains Wiki, Heroes Wiki, Anime and Manga Universe Wiki)"},{"mal_id":45627,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/45627\/Levi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/2\/241413.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/2\/241413.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/2\/241413t.webp"}},"name":"Levi","nicknames":[],"favorites":125369,"about":"Birthday: December 25\nHeight: 160 cm (5'3\")\nWeight: 65 kg (143 lbs)\nAffiliations: Scouting Legion, Special Operations Squad\n\nLevi is known as humanity's most powerful soldier.

At first glance, Luffy does not appear to be very intelligent, often seeing things in a childish manner and can easily be amazed by the simplest things. However, because he views the world in a straightforward and simple manner, he is occasionally the only person who can see past the events and see what should be done.\n\nLuffy seems to have an unstoppable appetite, a characteristic that is common to the Japanese archetype of the (at times simple-minded) young male hero\/adventurer with a heart of gold; perhaps the hunger more so in Luffy's case due to having an elastic stomach. Luffy is also another one of the several characters given the middle initial \"D.\"\n\nAlthough Luffy is fairly lightheaded and a funny character, he has an unstoppable sense of determination, optimism, and commitment and will do anything to stand up for his friends and comrades. Along with that, he has great courage to back it up as well as unbelievable strength. Ever since consuming the devil fruit he was shown to be not worried about his inability to swim, much like his brother. Much of these traits are common among D's. His only display of true fear is towards his grandfather, to the point that he is intimidated at the mere mention of him.\n\nLuffy never kills any of his enemies, no matter how cold-hearted they are; instead, he frequently sends the villain flying, knocking them out or beating them to a point that they are almost near death, which results in some of the villains searching for revenge, such as Buggy the Clown and Alvida. Oda explains that it's not a question of morality so much as a matter of punishing the villains for their crimes - he feels that killing the villains lets them off too lightly, whereas he considers letting them live to see their dreams be ruined a far more fitting punishment.\n\nLuffy's dream is to find the One Piece and become Pirate King.

Zoro is a skilled swordsman who fights with his own unique sword style known as santoryu (three katana fighting style).This is achieved by using one katana in each hand and another in his mouth. He is also seen fighting with only one or two swords. When in a serious fight he ties his bandana, normally tied on the arm, on his head.\n\nThough not a samurai, he appears to maintain a certain degree of bushido, and is frequently mistaken for one. Unlike Luffy and most of the other Straw Hat pirates, Zoro has been known to kill his opponents if he has to, though never in cold blood.\n\nZoro has a stern, serious and distanced personality, but, unlike Robin, he often reacts in a goofy and exaggerated comic style due to his gruff, impatient attitude. On the ship, he normally either trains with weights or sleeps. The only work he is seen doing regularly is hoisting the anchor using his great strength. He also likes sake, almost to the degree that Luffy likes meat, but like Nami, he never gets drunk due to his inhumanly-high endurance and tolerance for alcohol. Another notable trait is his lack of orientation, as Zoro often gets lost, even in small, familiar spaces or when being led by someone. Despite this, he is often the first to sense an enemy or danger, and the first to react. He is often displayed being well aware of dangerous situations and people around him.\n\nZoro often also reminds others of the harsh facts, which often shocks some of the other crew members, although they usually decide he is right. Zoro has also stated that he is an atheist, and has never believed in anything except himself. He often comes across as arrogant and overconfident, but only because he knows he's a strong man with great fighting ability. Even so, Zoro knows that he still has a lot of untapped potential, and is constantly seen training and trying to improve his fighting skills. He also adheres to a strict sword master's code of honor, and never falsely brags or lies about his abilities, sometimes outright admitting a weakness, even to an enemy. He also never tries to escape from a fight or use trickery to win, believing that doing so is cowardly and scorning anyone who uses such tactics. Zoro is very vigorous, strong-willed, and determined."},{"mal_id":35252,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/35252\/Rintarou_Okabe","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/6\/122643.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/6\/122643.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/6\/122643t.webp"}},"name":"Rintarou Okabe","nicknames":["Hououin Kyouma","Okarin","Mad Scientist"],"favorites":85331,"about":"Age: 18 (Steins;Gate), 19 (Steins;Gate 0)\nBirthdate: December 14, 1991 (Sagittarius)\nBlood Type: A\nHeight: 177 cm (5'10\")\nWeight: 59kg\nAffiliations: Future Gadget Lab\nOccupation: University Student\n\nRintaro Okabe (\u5ca1\u90e8 \u502b\u592a\u90ce Okabe Rintar\u014d?), often nicknamed Okarin (\u30aa\u30ab\u30ea\u30f3) or Hououin Kyouma (\u9cf3\u51f0\u9662\u51f6\u771f), is a self-proclaimed mad scientist and the main protagonist of the Steins;Gate series.\n\nOkabe is a theatrical and eccentric individual.

He is the youngest State Alchemist ever to be recognized by the Amestris State Military, having received the title at the age of 12. Ed's primary motivation throughout the series is to return his younger brother, Alphonse, to his original body, which was lost in a failed human transmutation. Edward, despite his occasional bouts of immaturity, is a selfless boy who gains a reputation as a \"hero of the people\" throughout his youth. Notably, he doesn't seem concerned about returning his own arm and leg, instead focusing entirely on Al's suffering.\n\nEdward is small for his age, standing at only 149 cm (4'11\"), however, his body is that of an experienced martial artist, with noticeable muscles and a wealth of agility. Although he lacks both his right arm and left leg, Ed's ability to fight is not impaired and is in fact improved, as he will often use alchemy to cause his metal arm to partly transform into a blade or shield. His heavy automail limbs are considered by him to be the very best in Amestris. They were made by his childhood friend, Winry Rockbell, and she is constantly working on them. He is able to think quickly, even in desperate situations, though can still be frightened into paralysis. These qualities, combined with his alchemical powers and physical strength, make him a formidable fighter.\n\nBorn to Trisha Elric and Van Hohenheim of Resembool in the winter of 1899, Edward's first few years were relatively happy; but after the sudden departure of his father during the lad's formative years, Ed was left with his mother and younger brother Alphonse as his only family. The three Elrics lived in peace in the rural village and the boys began displaying a remarkable talent for alchemy at a young age, much to the joyful astonishment of his mother. However, early in the year 1904, Trisha contracted an illness that had been spreading in the area and died, leaving her two sons orphaned. Even while mourning, mired in grief, Edward vowed to his brother that the two of them would find a way to bring their dead mother back to life with the power of alchemy.\n\nEdward and Alphonse spent the next few years living on their own in the Elric family home, supported by their close childhood friend Winry Rockbell and her grandmother Pinako, and pursuing the alchemical knowledge necessary for their planned resurrection. Although they had gained a great deal of information and comprehension regarding the extended basics of the craft, before long it became apparent to the young prodigies that there was only so far they could go while being self-taught. In a stroke of good fortune, Resembool was visited by an exceptionally skilled alchemist named Izumi Curtis who, after some persuasion, agreed to take the Elric brothers on as her apprentices provided they pass a preliminary test. After they do, the Elric brothers were subjected to Izumi's intensive alchemy and martial arts training, growing significantly in both mind and body and gaining a great deal of alchemical knowledge before returning to Resembool. \n\nThough instructed specifically by Izumi to understand that death is an irreversible part of the flow of the world and that acceptance of such is important to the \"One is All, All is One\" concept, the boys dove headlong into their plan to resurrect their mother upon their homecoming, having advanced their knowledge while abroad and discovered the basics of a forbidden practice called Human Transmutation.\n\nDevising a Human Transmutation Circle, amassing the elemental ingredients for an adult human body and offering their own blood as soul and biological data, the boys secretly initiated the Human Transmutation in their home. Unfortunately, the Human Transmutation resulted in a Rebound.\n\nAlphonse and Edward were pulled into The Gate. Encountering the mysterious being called Truth, Edward was stripped of his left leg in exchange for crossing into God's domain and peeking at the Gate's vast wealth of alchemical knowledge. Maimed and bleeding, Edward was returned to the human dimension to find that Alphonse had not yet returned from his disappearance into the Gate, that the mother they had attempted to revive was a grotesque mass of organs only capable of sustaining life for a few moments and that his own sojourn into the Gate had granted him the curious ability to perform transmutations merely by clapping his hands together, without the aid of a Transmutation Circle - in the same style used by Izumi. Desperate to at least have his brother by his side, Edward willfully performed another Human Transmutation to call him back, this time sacrificing his right arm in exchange for Al's soul, which he bound alchemically to an antique suit of armor with a Blood Rune before passing out from severe blood loss. Alphonse carried Ed to the Rockbell house, where a shocked Pinako and Winry performed emergency surgery to save the young boy's life.\n\nOn the night of the failed transmutation. Lt. Colonel Flame Alchemist Roy Mustang came to the Rockbell's in response to a letter that Edward and Alphonse had sent him in the mail asking about their Father. He was shocked at the fact that the two boys had tried human alchemy and survived, and informed them that they could become state alchemist and maybe one day find a way to return their bodies to the way they were. Desperate to get His younger brother's body back, Edward asked the Rockbells to give him prosthetic limbs called automail. Though they warned him the surgery would be painful, he said the pain was nothing compared to what his brother had given up. He only took a year to adapt to the automail at age 11 when it took most adults three years."},{"mal_id":17,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/17\/Naruto_Uzumaki","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/2\/284121.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/2\/284121.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/2\/284121t.webp"}},"name":"Naruto Uzumaki","nicknames":["Nine-Tails Jinchuuriki"],"favorites":74158,"about":"Age: 12-13 (Naruto part I), 15-17 (part II), 19 (The Last: Naruto the Movie), 27 (Naruto epilogue), 32 (Boruto: Naruto the Movie)\nBirthday: October 10\nBlood type: B\nHeight: 145\u2013147 cm (I), 166 cm (II), 174 cm (The Last: Naruto the Movie), 180 cm (Boruto: Naruto the Movie)\nWeight: 41\u201344 kg (I), 52 kg (II), 56 kg (The Last: Naruto the Movie), 66 kg (Boruto: Naruto the Movie)\nFavorite food: Ichiraku ramen\n\nBorn in Konohagakure, a ninja village hidden in the leaves, Naruto Uzumaki was destined for greatness.

Run, run and cling to life.\n\nBackground:\nItachi Uchiha is a missing-nin from Konohagakure, and a prominent member of Akatsuki, partnered with Kisame Hoshigaki. He is Sasuke Uchiha's older brother. \n\nItachi is relatively popular among many fans of Naruto, often having ranked in the top ten in Shonen Jump magazine's popularity polls since his introduction. He was first ranked in the third character popularity poll ranked in 11th place. He was ranked 9th place during the fourth popularity poll, and 6th place in the fifth popularity poll. During the sixth popularity poll, he again was ranked in 11th place. In the last poll, he was ranked in 5th place.\n\nItachi was born into the Uchiha clan and was praised by all as the best of his generation - a genius above all others. Even by the standards of the battle-adept Uchiha clan, Itachi's prowess far outshined all others. However, not even his family, friends, or teachers could understand him. When he was only 4, Itachi had already witnessed countless lives lost due to the Third Great Shinobi World War, which emotionally traumatized him and turned him into a pacifist. At age 7, he graduated from the Ninja Academy at the top of his class after only one year, mastered the Sharingan at age 8, passed the Chunin Exams at age 10, and became ANBU Captain at age 13. According to Madara Uchiha, Itachi also had a lover, whom he killed during the Uchiha clan massacre.\n\nHe was praised highly by his father, who saw the family's future in Itachi, hence neglecting his other son - Itachi's younger brother, Sasuke. However, during this time Itachi showed great affection towards his little brother, Sasuke, and even encouraged his father to come to the Academy when Sasuke was enrolled, something their dad had otherwise forgotten, by saying that he would not go to an important mission, that would establish Itachi a place in the ANBU ranks, otherwise.\n\n\nPersonality:\n\nAs a member of Akatsuki, he possessed incredible self-control of his emotions. He constantly displayed an emotionless personality. He only showed surprise when opponents proved more powerful or skilled than he had expected, and even then he didn't lose his composure. He did not possess any arrogance, and fully justified any statements he made about his power, even complimenting his opponents at times on their abilities.\n\nIn addition to being an extremely powerful ninja, Itachi had equally impressive intelligence, and was shown to be very wise. He was exceedingly sharp and observant to any situation at hand, as he was rarely surprised or caught off guard. He also displayed great intuition, as he was almost never deceived and even then almost instantly realized the truth. Despite his status as a wanted criminal, and having murdered a significant portion of his family, Itachi took no enjoyment in violence or combat, instead preferring to avoid battle or, if this was not possible, end it as quickly as he could.\n\nItachi's only initial interest was in Akatsuki's goals, and his only loyalties appeared to be to the organization and its members, seeming to put the organization's success and secrecy before everything else. As such, Itachi got along with his partner, Kisame, much better than most other Akatsuki members did with their own partners. Kisame appeared to have a deep loyalty to Itachi, immediately doing as he instructed and constantly looking out for his well-being. Itachi treated all of his fellow Akatsuki members to this same, more respectful personality, although his courtesy was rarely returned by the other members.\n\n\nDespite his status as an infamous shinobi, his appearance was not the most intimidating, apart from the intensity of his eyes. While living in Konoha, he would regularly have a gentle and caring look in his eyes, especially directed towards his younger brother. After joining Akatsuki, he would regularly have a stern look to them. He was a fairly tall shinobi, whose basic appearance was very much like the rest of his clan.\n\nHe, like all members of his clan, possessed dark grey eyes, and also had black hair that hung near his cheeks to frame his face. He also had the addition of a long ponytail in the back of his hair (which he obscured with his Akatsuki cloak after joining the organization). Being brothers, Itachi and Sasuke had a similar appearance, but with subtle differences. Itachi's hair color appeared slightly duller and with a softer flow to it, without the spiky style at the back. His skin was also slightly darker. Itachi's most distinguishing characteristics were the long pronounced creases under his eyes.\n\nWhen he lived in Konoha, his casual clothes would consist of a black shirt with a large Uchiha clan symbol on the back of it, and black pants with a weapons pouch strapped to them. When on duty, he would wear the traditional ANBU uniform, although he was never shown wearing a mask. As a member of Akatsuki, he wore the traditional Akatsuki cloak, and usually kept the center of it buttoned down. After his cloak was incinerated by Sasuke's Kirin during their fight in Part II, it was revealed that he still wore his casual clothes underneath it. Like almost all members of Akatsuki, he wore the headband of his home village, Konoha, with a line gouged through it, to symbolize his broken ties with the village \nAbilities:\nSince a young age, Itachi's intellect and talent showed their brilliance in everything he did, as even his teachers said his progress hardly required any help. In the few battles he had been seen in since the start of the series, Itachi was shown to be an incredibly powerful ninja, and easily one of the strongest in the Naruto series, as demonstrated by his ability to easily defeat Deidara, Sasuke, Kakashi Hatake, Kurenai Yuhi and Orochimaru (twice), who themselves are considered amongst the strongest ninjas in Naruto. Being a pacifist, Itachi did not actively take part in battle, typically only acting in self-defense.\n\nSharingan:\nBeing of the Uchiha Clan, and as noted by Kakashi, Itachi was a true successor of the Sharingan Eye. From a stationary position, he would study an opponent's movements with his Sharingan and respond accordingly, often with a genjutsu. He could cast a genjutsu by merely pointing at or looking at someone, and could similarly turn an opponent's genjutsu against them with Demonic Illusion: Mirror Heaven and Earth Change. Itachi had trained so much with his eyes that he had reached the stage where he could have his Sharingan activated the entire time, with minimal drain on his chakra levels. \n\nMangekyo Sharingan:\nItachi possessed the Mangekyo Sharingan, which increased his already great power, and enabled him to use his most powerful techniques. With his left eye, he could use Tsukuyomi, a genjutsu that traps an opponent's mind in an illusionary world, torturing them for what seems like days in a matter of seconds.With his right eye he could use Amaterasu, a ninjutsu which allowed him to create a black flame that he could direct by moving his eye to burn through seemingly anything in its path, including fire itself. His final technique was Susanoo, a technique that manifested itself as a spectral being, labelled as the \"Raging God of Battle\" in the databook. It wielded the Totsuka Sword, an ethereal sword with the ability to seal anything it pierces into the gourd that serves as its hilt, and Yata's Mirror, a shield that can reflect any attack. Zetsu, a fellow Akatsuki member, stated that Itachi's mastery of the Sharingan, combined with the legendary weapons of Susanoo, made him invincible.\n\n\n(Source: Naruto.com, Naruto Wikia)"},{"mal_id":14,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/14\/Itachi_Uchiha","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/284122.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/284122.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/284122t.webp"}},"name":"Itachi Uchiha","nicknames":[],"favorites":56530,"about":"Age: 17-18 (I); 21 (II)\nBirthday: June 9th (Gemini)\nHeight: 175 cm (I); 178 cm (II)\nWeight: 57 kg (I); 58 kg (II)\nBlood Type: AB\nNature Type: Fire and Water\nFrom: Konohagakure (Leaf)\nRank: S-class Missing-Nin\nRegistered Ninja #: 012110\nAffiliation: Akatsuki\nRing: Shu (Red)\nFinger Position: Right Ring\nPartner: Hoshigaki Kisame\nFavorite Foods: Rice balls (kelp), cabbage, Dango\nLeast Favorite Foods: Steak\nHobby: Visiting traditional Japanese caf\u00e9s\nFirst Manga Appearance: Ch. 139\nFirst Anime Appearance: Ep. 80\nAssignments Completed: 53 D-Rank, 152 C-Rank, 134 B-Rank, 0 A-Rank, 1 S-Rank\nFamous Quote: Foolish little brother, if you wish to kill me, hate me, detest me, and survive in an unsightly way.

When drawn in a more 'action-oriented' style with more detail, Saitama is revealed to have sharp features, dangerous looking eyes, and chiseled musculature. His costume is a plain yellow jumpsuit with a short zipper at the collar and a belt. The costume is finished out by an ensemble of red boots and gloves, and a white cape.\n\nFor a superhero, Saitama is rather laid back. Because even the mightiest foes pose no challenge to him, he doesn't take his hero work very seriously. In spite of this, he is constantly searching for an opponent that can challenge him, since his superhero work is beginning to bore him because it's too easy. The combination of his attitude, unstoppable strength, and distinctively simple and 'unimpressive' appearance often cause his battles to become anticlimactic.

Kakashi, however, seems indifferent to their rivalry, which annoys Guy to no end. Guy randomly challenges Kakashi to contests of skill, and Kakashi has acquired a record of 49 wins and 50 losses in doing so. Given that the contests that make up this figure are so varied (ranging from Rock, Paper, Scissors to sumo-wrestling), this is not much of an achievement on Guy's part. Nevertheless, Guy is proud of his record.\n\nThough he evasively says that he has \"many hobbies\" when asked about himself, he is commonly seen reading of \"Icha Icha Paradise\" (\u30a4\u30c1\u30e3\u30a4\u30c1\u30e3\u30d1\u30e9\u30c0\u30a4\u30b9, Icha Icha Paradaisu, literally \"Make Out Paradise\"), an adult and probably pornographic novel authored by Jiraiya that is a runaway bestseller in the Naruto world. Kakashi most prominently reads it while training and speaking with his team, and is later seen reading the second known volume in the series, \"Icha Icha Violence\" (\u30a4\u30c1\u30e3\u30a4\u30c1\u30e3\u30d0\u30a4\u30aa\u30ec\u30f3\u30b9, Icha Icha Baiorensu, literally \"Make Out Violence\"). In Part II Naruto gives him the new \"Icha Icha Tactics\" (\u30a4\u30c1\u30e3\u30a4\u30c1\u30e3\u30bf\u30af\u30c6\u30a3\u30af\u30b9, Icha Icha Takutikusu, literally \"Make Out Tactics\").\n\nKakashi's Sharingan eye gives him a significant advantage in battle, as he can copy enemy techniques and use them as his own, as well as track and predict his opponent's movements flawlessly. Because it is a transplanted eye, his Sharingan eye is always active. While this would not be much of a problem for an Uchiha, his non-Uchiha blood causes it to use much more chakra than it should. Because of this, he covers it with his headband and only utilizes it in the most dangerous battles. Kakashi's use of the Sharingan is as good as that of Itachi Uchiha, though the aforementioned handicaps brought about by the nature of his eye make him somewhat weaker in comparison. In Part II Kakashi is able to develop his own Mangekyo Sharingan. With his variant he is able to manipulate space-time to conduct long range attacks, and in its two uses has been capable of severing another's arms and otherwise sending things to different dimensions. Much like the standard Sharingan, the Mangekyo Sharingan tires Kakashi considerably, and after using it only three times he was hospitalized for a week due to its chakra usage.\n\nWith his Sharingan Kakashi has been able to copy more than one thousand jutsu, giving him the nickname \"Copy Ninja Kakashi\". As a result, Kakashi's arsenal most prominently features ninjutsu abilities and has led to him becoming a specialist in the field. Many of the jutsu he has been seen copying in the series are water-based attacks, though most of these he only uses against the person he copies them from. He does, however, use Water Release: Water Encampment Wall on occasion as a way to block attacks. He less frequently uses other elemental attacks such as Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique to attack opponents or Earth Release: Inner Decapitation Technique (\u571f\u9041\u30fb\u5fc3\u4e2d\u65ac\u9996\u306e\u8853, Doton: Shinj\u016b Zanshu no Jutsu, Viz \"Groundhog Technique Decapitation\", English TV \"Headhunter Jutsu\") to pull opponents below ground and immobilize them. He can also create shadow clones, though because he lacks Naruto's chakra reserves, he exercises the ability with caution, rarely creating more than one at a time.\n\nWhile Kakashi specializes in the use of ninjutsu due to his Sharingan he is fairly adept with other jutsu types, though his use of them is rarely seen. Demonic Illusion: Hell Viewing Technique (\u9b54\u5e7b\u30fb\u5948\u70d9\u898b\u306e\u8853, Magen: Narakumi no Jutsu) causes his opponent to see what they would find a horrifying vision, keeping them preoccupied until they can overcome the illusion. A Thousand Years of Pain (death in english dub) (\u5343\u5e74\u6bba\u3057, Sennen Goroshi) consists of Kakashi forcefully plunging his index and middle fingers into an opponent's rectum. While only capable of launching the opponent humorous distances in typical uses, the fingers can be replaced with kunai attached with exploding tags to actually do damage to the person one is attacking.\n\nWhen he was younger, Kakashi was taught how to use the Rasengan by the Fourth Hokage. Because the Rasengan is meant to have the user's chakra nature mixed with it, Kakashi attempted to add his lightning-based chakra to it, though was ultimately unsuccessful. In time he instead created the Chidori, his only original jutsu. After the jutsu's initial creation, Kakashi was unable to use the Chidori to its full potential as the sheer speed of the attack left his normal eyes unable to see any form of an enemy counterattack. After acquiring the Sharingan, however, he was able to overcome this shortcoming. Through repeated use and increased proficiency with it, Kakashi's Chidori has been upgraded and renamed to the Lightning Blade due to him having cut through a bolt of lightning with it."},{"mal_id":1,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/1\/Spike_Spiegel","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/50197.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/50197.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/50197t.webp"}},"name":"Spike Spiegel","nicknames":[],"favorites":41059,"about":"Birthdate: June 26, 2044\nHeight: 185 cm (6' 1\")\nWeight: 70 kg (155 lbs)\nBlood type: O\nPlanet of Origin: Mars\n\nSpike Spiegel is a tall and lean 27-year-old bounty hunter born on Mars. The inspiration for Spike is found in martial artist Bruce Lee who uses the martial arts style of Jeet Kune Do as depicted in Session 8, \"Waltz For Venus\". He has fluffy, dark green hair (which is inspired by Yusaku Matsuda's) and reddish brown eyes, one of which is artificial and lighter than the other. He is usually dressed in a blue leisure suit, with a yellow shirt and Lupin III inspired boots. A flashback in Session 6 revealed it was his fully functioning right eye which was surgically replaced by the cybernetic one (although Spike himself may not have conscious recollection of the procedure since he claims to have lost his natural eye in an \"accident\"). One theory is that his natural eye may have been lost during the pre-series massacre in which he supposedly \"died\". The purpose of this cybernetic eye is never explicitly stated, though it apparently gives him exceptional hand-eye coordination - particularly with firearms (Spike's gun of choice is a Jericho 941, as seen throughout the series). In the first episode, when facing a bounty-head using Red Eye, Spike mocks him, calling his moves \"too slow\". At first, this seems like posturing on Spike's part, but even with his senses and reflexes accelerated to superhuman levels by the drug, the bounty cannot even touch Spike. A recurring device throughout the entire show is a closeup on Spike's fully-natural left eye before dissolving to a flashback of his life as part of the syndicate. As said by Spike himself in the last episode, his right eye \"only sees the present\" and his left eye \"only sees the past.\" Spike often has a bent cigarette between his lips, sometimes despite rain or \"No Smoking\" signs."},{"mal_id":164471,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/164471\/Satoru_Gojou","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/15\/422168.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/15\/422168.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/15\/422168t.webp"}},"name":"Satoru Gojou","nicknames":["The Strongest Jujutsu Sorcerer"],"favorites":39526,"about":"Age: 28\nBirthday: December 7, 1989\nHeight: 190 cm (6' 3\")\nClan: Gojou Clan\nHair: White\nEyes: Light Blue\nGrade: Special Grade\nAbilities\nImmense Strength, Immense Speed &amp; Reflexes, Tactical Intellect, High Skill, Immense Cursed Energy, Infinity, Cursed Technique Lapse: Blue, Cursed Technique Reversal: Red, Hollow Purple, Six Eyes, Limitless, Domain Expansion: Unlimited Void. \n\nSatoru Gojou is the first-year teacher at Tokyo Metropolitan Magic Technical College.\n\nWhen interacting with his students and friends, he is known to be quite playful and carefree.

Mai is also very intelligent, she's implied to have very good grades and even helps Sakuta study at one point. \n\nMai found early fame as a model for television, magazines, and books, due to the fact that her mother ran a photographing agency. While she did enjoy her job as a model in the show business, the pressure of being in the public began to take it's toll on her. After being tricked forced to participate in a swimsuit photoshoot by her mother in her early school years, Mai realized she was simply used as a tool to make her mother easy money and took a hiatus from acting as a way to get back at her, and decided to attend high school. \n\nHowever, because of work commitments made prior to her decision to go on hiatus she wasn't able to attend school until half-way through her first year. By then, social circles had formed, making her the \"odd one out\" causing her to be isolated. As a result, the student body didn't know how to deal with her; While they had no reason to bully her, they also feared associating with her would cause themselves to be isolated as well.\n\n\nTwo years and several months since beginning her hiatus, Mai went to a library wearing a bunny costume to see if anyone would notice her. She then came across a boy named Sakuta Azusagawa, who was the only person in the building who was able to see her. After introducing themselves however, Mai ordered Sakuta to forget about her.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Source: Seishun Buta Yarou Wiki, edited)"},{"mal_id":23602,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/23602\/Shinobu_Oshino","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/234167.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/234167.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/234167t.webp"}},"name":"Shinobu Oshino","nicknames":["Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade","Fair Princess"],"favorites":31219,"about":"Shinobu is a girl who lives with Meme in an abandoned building.

Due to her often snapping at others in brutal ways and her short stature, she is given the nickname \"Palmtop Tiger.\"\n\nHer under-developed body and the added nickname has given her a complex which in turn serves to give her a negative attitude and facial expression. Essentially, Taiga gets upset easily and is considerably clumsy. She is also brutally honest, typically when she is lashing out at someone. Due to her cute looks (described as a doll by Ryuuji), she often gets confessions of love by boys, but she turns down every one of them, including Yuusaku Kitamura (which she later regrets).\n\nDespite coming from a well-to-do family, her life with them is very difficult because of various problems. Her father and mother got a divorce, leaving Taiga with her father. When he remarried another woman who was significantly younger than himself, it caused misunderstandings between Taiga and her step-mother. One day it became too much for Taiga, causing her to run away from home and since then, she has taken to living on her own. Since she came from a privileged household, she does not know how to do any domestic chores. When she meets Ryuuji and learns of his domestic talents, she ends up relying on Ryuuji to clean up after her. Aside from sleeping in her own house, and going to school, she spends most of her time at Ryuuji's house; so much so that she is considered a member of his family.\n\nAt the beginning of the story, she is infatuated with Ryuuji's best friend Yuusaku Kitamura and gets nervous every time he appears around her. Ryuuji finds out due to a misplaced empty love letter from Taiga meant for Kitamura. Ryuuji then admits to having feelings for Taiga's best friend Minori.

She made a promise with men from a town called Pasloe where she would ensure the town would have good wheat harvests year after year.

As such, Holo escapes from town in Lawrence's wagon and started traveling with him to see how much the world has changed since she has been in Pasloe.

She is typically very haughty and self-sufficient, though due to her isolation for hundreds of years in Pasloe, she gradually feels very lonely, and sometimes shows a more fragile side of herself.

His main way of spending time is peering up girls' skirts in a local mall. He is very athletic, as he can bench press 150 kg (331 lbs), has a second dan black belt in karate, and even claims to perform 500 push-ups, 1000 pull ups and 2000 squats daily.\n\nThrough the events explained in the Great Teacher Onizuka manga, Onizuka decides to become a teacher, even though it is later implied that he has an IQ of about 50 (Though not necessarily true). His initial teacher training is in the Musashino Public High School, where he meets Nanako Mizuki. His experience taming the rowdy gangs in his assigned class hardens his convictions that teaching is the way to go, and when he learns of Mizuki's problems, he also decides to abstain from sexual experience with his students, opting to solve their personal issues for them, instead.\n\nUnfortunately, he nearly messes up by forgetting to take the public teachers' civil service exam. As a result, no public high school will take him, but he is still eligible for a number of private schools. He manages to get a job at the upper-crust Holy Forest Academy, despite the objections of vice-principal Uchiyamada Hiroshi, whom he continues to aggravate well into his tenure. Of course, one of the conditions of having the job at Holy Forest is that he must sleep at the school\u2014in the storage room at the top floor, with roof access\u2014and it is here that Onizuka officially starts his career in teaching, when he stops Yoshikawa Noboru from committing suicide.\n\nOnizuka is put in charge of class 3-4, a class so bad it has already driven several teachers insane. Not only does he survive the class's brutal bullying tactics, but he also befriends his students, and the backbone to the story of Great Teacher Onizuka consists of his unique experiences in turning his students around and learning lessons of his own.\n\nIt is later implied again, during the National Exams, that Onizuka might actually be some sort of genius. His exam results were swapped: once for full marks, and once for just short of full marks. However, when Yoshito Kikuchi is asked whether he is curious about Onizuka's true results, he checks the answers himself and the result amazes him. He checks with Onizuka, who states that he definitely got perfect results from his own effort (which would be incredible, since he did a 5 hour exam in 1 hour, bleeding, and having 4 bullets in his stomach).\n\nOnizuka has incredible physical resilience. On more than one occasion, he has fallen from heights that would instantly kill most people and claims to have a sort of healing factor, as he healed from a broken arm in less than a day, and even endure multiple gunshot wounds, in a short period of time. Onizuka often presents his strength in unintentionally flamboyant ways, such as arm wrestling over 100 men of exponential strength in a row and winning (including the character Heihachi from the Tekken series of fighting games, and Jason Voorhees from the films called Friday the 13th (series)). His fighting abilities are not to be taken lightly either, as Onizuka is capable of fending off multiple opponents, even if they are well-armed, and almost never receives any physical damage.\n\nIn spite of his impressive fighting skills, Onizuka is often roughed up by his students, and others, whenever he behaves badly. It could be speculated that deep down, Onizuka knows when he's acting immature, and allows others to keep him in line. An example of this is when he forces his students to dig the earth for buried treasure during the Okinawa trip. Kanzaki Urumi kicks Onizuka into a hole, and later forces him to wear S&amp;M garb and has him crawl around on all fours, with Urumi riding on his back. Yet another example is when Principal Uchiyamada has Onizuka over for dinner and hits him upside the head with a wooden bench after finding out that Onizuka was acting a bit of a letch with his daughter one day (Onizuka was playing \"where's the nipple\" with his daughter, at a karaoke bar in town).\n\nHis personal mode of transportation is a Kawasaki Z2 motorcycle 750cc type S. The bike itself is also featured heavily in the prequel series to GTO."},{"mal_id":5,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/5\/Ichigo_Kurosaki","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/3\/89190.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/3\/89190.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/3\/89190t.webp"}},"name":"Ichigo Kurosaki","nicknames":["Ichi-nii","Shinigami Daiko (Substitute Soul Reaper)","Itsygo","Ryoka Boy"],"favorites":25887,"about":"Race: Human, Shinigami, \nBirthday: July 15 (Cancer)\nAge: 15 (beginning); 17 (currently)\nHeight: 174-&gt;181 cm\nWeight: 61-&gt;66 kg\nKnown Relatives: Isshin Kurosaki (father), Masaki Kurosaki (mother, deceased), Yuzu Kurosaki (younger sister), Karin Kurosaki (younger sister),  \nTheme Songs: \"Number One\" by Hazel Fernandes, \"News From the Front\" by Bad Religion\n\nFor the most part, Ichigo appears like a normal teenage boy, the one exception to that is his spiky, orange hair, a trait which he has been ridiculed about for years. He is a fairly tall, and lean-built person with peach skin and brown eyes. Since becoming a Shinigami, he has become noticeably more muscular, as noted by his sister Karin. When in his spiritual form, Ichigo wears standard Shinigami attire with the addition of a strap across his chest.\n\nWhen he was young, Ichigo considered his mother to be the center of his world. Ichigo always smiled whenever he was with Masaki and he was regularly at her side, holding her hand.\n\nAs a teenager, Ichigo's personality is much more complex. Stubborn, short-tempered, occasionally confrontational, determined, outspoken, strong-willed and impulsive, he attempts to maintain a detached and \"cool\" image, despite claiming to not care about what other people think about him. He generally keeps his face set in a permanent scowl with his eyebrows drawn together. Ichigo carries the burden of the real world and the spirit world (Soul Society), a task quite difficult, especially for a teenager like Ichigo, who has his own worries and problems. Also, Ichigo is quite smart; he was ranked 23rd in his high school. He does this partly to prove to his teachers and classmates that just because he's unique, or somewhat punkish, that he can still succeed.\n\nWhen Ichigo first becomes a Shinigami, his Zanpakut\u014d is a standard-looking katana, but oversized with an equally-oversized brown sheathe hung by a strap over his right shoulder. It has a rectangular bronze hand guard with gently inward-curved edges, a stylized flame pattern on the long sides, and a simple decorative slit on the short ones. The handle is red with two light blue tassels on the end of the handle. The large size is due to the unfocused but immense amount of Ichigo's spiritual power, which he didn't know how to control. As a result, the sword itself was rather weak, since very little spiritual power was used to create it. Nevertheless, it was powerful enough to subdue a Gillian-class Menos and lesser Hollows, completely blocking a Cero from the former. It was even able to upturn the ground with a single strike. Because of its weak spiritual energy nature, Byakuya Kuchiki was able to easily cut off most of the blade during his first encounter with Ichigo and Kisuke Urahara subsequently slices it down to the hilt during their training, forcing Ichigo to learn the name of his Zanpakut\u014d in order to release its true form. This sword is found to be a result of Rukia's deprived spiritual energy and not a result of his own power."},{"mal_id":13,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/13\/Sasuke_Uchiha","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/131317.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/131317.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/131317t.webp"}},"name":"Sasuke Uchiha","nicknames":[],"favorites":25769,"about":"Age: 12-13 (I); 16-17 (II); 19 (The Last: Naruto the Movie); 32 (Boruto: Naruto the Movie)\nBirthday: July 23\nNinja Registration No: 012606\nHoroscope: Leo\nBlood type: AB\nHeight: 153.2 cm(I); 168 cm (II); 175 cm (The Last: Naruto the Movie); 182 cm (Boruto: Naruto the Movie)\nWeight: 43.5kg(I); 52.2kg (II); 55kg (The Last: Naruto the Movie); 65kg (Boruto: Naruto the Movie)\nHair: Ebony Black with Blue tints\nEyes: Black; Right eye Red (when using Sharingan) &amp; Left eye Purple (when using Rinnengan)\nRank: Genin; \nKekkei Genkai: Sharingan (Part 1)\n\n\nLikes: Omusubi (Okaka) (omusubi is like Onigiri: Okaka is dried Bonito) Tomato\nDislikes: Everything that gets in the way of his revenge, natto (fermented soybeans) and sweet food\nHates: Itachi (Part I)\n\nTalents: Highly skilled ninja, specializes in fire and lightning jutsu.\n\nWhen Sasuke was young, his clan was murdered by his older brother, Itachi. With his parents and family now gone, his brother spared him and left him to survive by himself. He told Sasuke to hate him. Sasuke tried to forget about the past by applying himself in the ninja academy and fitting in with the rest of the leaf village.\n\nAfter his fight with Naruto, he believes he's been wasting his time \"playing ninja\" with the people of the leaf village. His new goal is to get stronger so he can avenge his clan by killing Itachi and then restore the Uchiha clan.\n\nAs a wielder of the Sharingan (the kekkei genkai of the Uchiha clan), he learns to use Chidori and has a vast knowledge of the various Fire Jutsus. The curse seal which Orichimaru gives him during the Chuunin exam, at first, enhanced his power but at the risk of killing him. Now he can use it of his own free will.\n\nClaiming at first that he doesn't need any friends, he is forced to contradict himself when he sees that either Naruto or Sakura are in danger. Remembering this type of Sasuke is what brings motivation to Naruto. Sasuke openly admitted to Naruto that he was his closest friend.\n\nAppearance\nSasuke has black hair with a blue tint that lengthens as the story goes with onyx eyes and has lighter skin than his brother Itachi. Like many other members of his clan, his hair hangs over both sides of his face to roughly his cheeks. In his curse seal form, he has grey skin with wings on his back that resemble giant webbed hands. He also has hair similar to Madara Uchiha except in a greyish-blue color.\n\nAt the beginning of Part I, Sasuke's clothing made up a blue, short-sleeved shirt with a raised collar and the Uchiha crest on the back and white shorts. An interesting thing is that during Part I the Uchiha symbol on his back gets smaller each time he changes his outfit. In the last stage of the Chunin exams, he wore a black, one pieced version of this outfit but eventually went back to his original clothes.\n\nIn Part II, Sasuke has grown noticeably taller (almost eye height with Itachi) and slightly more muscular. wears a white long sleeved shirt that's open at the torso with a smaller version of the Uchiha crest on his collar. He wears black pants with a blue cloth hanging from his half way up his stomach to his knees. He also wears a purple rope belt (Japanese name: Shimenawa) tied in a bow fashion found on many Sound ninja, only the bow is in a different style and is tied in the front instead of the back. He also will at points remove his shirt and hang it from his belt around his waist to give his wings in Curse Seal Level 2 room to move (also without transforming)."},{"mal_id":118489,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/118489\/Shouto_Todoroki","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/332527.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/332527.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/332527t.webp"}},"name":"Shouto Todoroki","nicknames":[],"favorites":25048,"about":"Age: 15\nBirthday: January 11\nBlood Type: O\nHeight: 176 cm (5'9\")\nAffiliation: U.A.\nQuirk: Half-Cold Half-Hot\n\nShouto Todoroki is a student at Yuuei training to become a Pro Hero.

He has superb fighting skills that only make use of his legs, in an effort to minimize damage to his hands which would impair his cooking skills. Sanji uses an array of powerful and varied kicking moves when he fights. His cooking skills are world class, and he was mentored in both cooking and fighting by Chef \"Red Leg\" Zeff of the Baratie. He was born in the North Blue, but grew up in the East Blue.\n\nSanji is trash-talking and serious, and usually gruff and impatient, especially around men. This is contrasted by his \"love-cook\" side, as he is very amorous around women. Sanji is completely devoted to any beautiful woman, usually losing all common sense and composure in front of them, then attempting to comically swoon them. This behavior has earned him the nickname \"ero-cook,\" or perverted cook. He can also be very chivalrous and gentlemanly around women, volunteering to help them in various tasks and situations, whether they need help or not. He has sworn to never let insult or injury happen to any woman while he can still stand, even if that woman is trying to kill him. This is often problematic in his fighting as he can't attack female opponents, and would rather die than hurt them. All this is apparently the result of a \"strict upbringing.\" To contradict his gentlemanly behavior, Sanji also enjoys seeing women wear skimpy clothing, and can be a voyeur.\n\nHis goal in life is to find the All Blue, a legendary ocean, which contains all the fish in the world. As such, it would be paradise for any cook with as much love for his work as Sanji, who holds great respect for the tools, ingredients, and art of cooking. So great is his devotion to his calling, that Sanji will not let any person or creature starve, regardless of them being friend or foe.\n\nBeing the crew's chef, he looks out for the health of his crewmates. Sanji respects Luffy as a captain, but often gets angry at him for eating too much, showing disrespect for the aesthetics of cooking, and generally being daft and irresponsible. He is constantly in petty fights with Zoro (sometimes calling him Marimo) over each others' traits and they have developed a rivalry, but have managed to make a devastating team together. He is very protective of the female crew members and Nami likes to take advantage of him, exploiting his extreme servility. Sanji originally wanted to cook Chopper, but has come to respect him as a crew member and friend. He's also good friends with Usopp; they team up and interact often, and Sanji understands him quite well. In short, he cares as much for the crew as any Straw Hat should, but unlike Zoro, Sanji shows these feelings more."},{"mal_id":117909,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/117909\/Izuku_Midoriya","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/7\/299404.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/7\/299404.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/7\/299404t.webp"}},"name":"Izuku Midoriya","nicknames":["Deku"],"favorites":24478,"about":"Age: 14-16\nBirthday: July 15\nBlood type: O\nHeight: 166 cm (5'5\")\nAffiliation: U.A.\nQuirk: One For All\n\nIzuku Midoriya is the main protagonist of Boku no Hero Academia.

She barely talks to other students in her school and exhibits a desire to be left alone as exemplified by her tendency to stay on the school's rooftop, away from the rest of the students. She is secretly a Magus and a Master in the Fifth Holy Grail War. In the beginning of the anime, she summons Archer for her Servant, although she originally wanted to summon Saber. Rin is reared as the successor to her family's magecraft, instructed by her father Tokiomi Toosaka to prioritize sorcery over her own interests.\n\nTwo centuries ago, the Toosaka House, in collaboration with the estates of Makiri and Einzbern, helped found the Fuyuki Holy Grail Wars. The land of Fuyuki City, which possessed the second greatest spiritual power in all Japan, was owned by Rin's ancestor, Nagato Toosaka; at the behest of the Einzberns, he provided his property as battleground for present and future wars. Nagato was a kirishitan, as well as a pupil of Zelretch; these titles gave him considerable influence in both the Mage's Association and the Church, allowing the Toosaka family to participate in the Holy Grail Wars, free from harassment by either organization.\n\nRin was brought up as the successor to her family's magecraft, and was instructed by her father to prioritize magecraft over her own interests. Ten years ago, Tokiomi Toosaka was selected as a Master in the 4th Holy Grail War, and Rin was entrusted to take care of the Toosaka estate until his return. Her mother, Aoi Toosaka, was left in a debilitated state from the war, so her care was left to her guardian, Kirei Kotomine. After her father was killed, Rin continued to improve her sorcery with some guidance from Kirei Kotomine. To divert attention from her private life, Rin has diligently strived to earn the admiration of her peers, even though she is secretly stingy, tomboyish, and a slacker.\n\nThe rights to the Toosaka lands were inherited by Aoi after Tokiomi's death, and subsequently inherited by Rin after Aoi's death. Kirei managed them as Rin's guardian, and because of his foolhardy and coarse management, the majority of profitable properties ended up in the hands of others. It is possible that he believed the wealth was bad for her upbringing due to following the principles of humility and poverty.\n\nAlthough Rin resents the sacrifices she has endured for the sake of tradition, she is fiercely competitive and eager to prove herself as a skilled and capable magus. She was immensely disappointed at summoning Archer and ended up in a quarrel with him; however, the duo soon reconciled, set aside their differences and quickly got along.\n\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":246,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/246\/Gokuu_Son","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/15\/72546.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/15\/72546.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/15\/72546t.webp"}},"name":"Gokuu Son","nicknames":["Kakarot"],"favorites":22153,"about":"Race: Saiyan\nHeight: 5'9\" (175,3 cm)\nWeight: 145 lbs (65,8 kg)\nBirth year: 737 Age\nHobby: Fighting strong opponents\nFavorite food: Everything\nFavorite vehicle: Kintoun (Nimbus)\n\nOriginally named Kakarot, Gokuu is born a member of a race of extraterrestrials called the Saiyans. Shortly following his birth, Gokuu is sent from his native planet Vegeta to Earth, for potential selling on the intergalactic market by destroying all its life; Goku was also sent away to escape Freeza's genocide of the Saiyans. Once he lands on Earth, he is adopted by an old man named Gohan (who is later just called Grandpa Gohan). At first, Goku is very violent as a kid due to his Saiyan blood, but due to an injury to his head that caused him severe amnesia, Gokuu changes to a more tempered, innocent boy. At the start of the series, Gokuu meets Bulma, Yamucha, Oolong, and Pu'ar, whose characters mirror those found in Wu Cheng'en's Journey to the West. He also encounters Kuririn, who eventually becomes his best friend, and others during his journey for more strength. Participating in several World Martial Arts Tournaments, Gokuu also battles foes-turned-allies such as Tenshinhan and Chaozu, as well as the offspring of Demon King Piccolo named Majunior (later, he's named just Piccolo).\n\nDragon Ball Z takes place 5 years after Gokuu's victory against Piccolo in the 23rd Budokai Tenkaichi. He now has a son named Son Gohan (named after Grandpa Gohan) who lacks his father's love of fighting but has a great hidden potential himself. Throughout the series, Gokuu &amp; Gohan face terribly strong opponents like other powerful Saiyans, a space tyrant, artificial humans, Majins &amp; Gods that threaten Earth while also giving them exhilarating fights. Along with new enemies, they also gain new friends that help in these situations. As well as becoming more powerful, Gokuu learns to accept his forgotten Saiyan heritage (this gives him a small identity crisis when Raditz reveals his past, and is something he carries with him into the proceeding Namek arc) &amp; consistently comes across the predicament of killing an opponent (he starts out killing without much thought to the moral consequences of taking a life, and only after training under Kami does he start to struggle with killing a person; this comes to a head when he fights Freeza on Namek).\n\nIn Dragon Ball GT, which is not based on Toriyama's manga, Gokuu is turned into a child by Pilaf via the Black-Star Dragon Balls. The series revolves around him traveling around space to find the Black Star Dragon Balls with the help of his granddaughter Pan and Trunks. After collecting the spheres, Gokuu does battle with Baby (a Tuffle who wants revenge on all Saiyans for killing his race), Super 17 (a powered-up version of former enemy Artificial Human 17) and various Evil Dragons (the physical constructs of negative energy accumulated in the Dragon Balls; they are called Shadow Dragons in FUNimation's dub). The series ends with Gokuu leaving for good with Shenron and returning 100 years later to witness the match between Gokuu Jr. and Vegeta Jr.\n\nIn Dragon Ball Online (which takes place 216 years after Dragon Ball Z, in which Toriyama had a lot of creative control over the story, unlike Dragon Ball GT), a new villain by the name of Miira appears with the goal to obtain Gokuu's DNA.\n\nIn Cross Epoch, the Dragon Ball and One Piece crossover one-shot, Gokuu is seen accompanying Luffy to attend a party hosted by Shenron from whom key characters from both series had received an invitation.\n\nIn Dragon Ball Minus, it is revealed that Gokuu was sent away by his mother and father (Gine &amp; Bardock) to escape Freeza's genocide of the Saiyans. Gokuu leaves Planet Vegeta in his pod with a forlorn look as his parents send him away.\n\nGokuu is known for his laid-back personality and his love of fighting worthy opponents. He will eat anything without much qualms. He has an uncanny ability to make allies out of foes he has fought (in some cases to the death), though his capacity for sparing his enemies has occasionally been criticized as foolish (Gokuu generally only fights to win and improve himself, and spares his enemies after winning only for them to attack him when his back is turned). Gokuu can also be very blunt, and not afraid to express his opinion in a discussion, such as when he questioned Krillin's marriage to Android 18 (who was not fully human and a previous enemy who threatened his life). Despite his kind-hearted nature, Gokuu can feel incredible anger in cases of extreme turmoil, such as the death of a close friend\/relative, or when someone murders many innocents needlessly. He has a simple, practical view of the world and is somewhat naive to the world around him. Because of this, many characters incorrectly assume him to be somewhat stupid, although once he has a basic understanding of things, he learns very quickly. His most remarkable ability is his will to succeed, his tenacity and persistence.\n\nHe's so focused on improving himself as a warrior that some of the decisions he makes are detrimental to the survival of humanity or those who he cares about. Such examples include when he purposefully chose not to help his friends and family when they were attacked by Beerus at Bulma's birthday so as to study his opponent, or when he elected not to destroy Gero's lab in favor of his curiosity at his potential opponents' strength even though it might've meant the destruction of mankind. This is also touched upon when he spares Vegeta for a rematch in the Saiyan arc, despite this also being a threat to humanity. However, he has shown to be able to slightly curb this selfishness, as he elected to not return to life after dying in the fight against Cell so that Earth would not be endangered by the evil people he tends to attract (although, Goku is also interested in fighting the masters in the afterlife indicating some slight selfishness was still apparent).\n\nGoku has also admitted to not being good at creating things, and being better at breaking stuff at the end of Dragon Ball Kai. In Dragon Ball Super Ep. 4, Goku is revealed not to be much of a party-goer. He has also shown an affinity with training younger kids (like how he did with Gohan in the Androids arc, Goten &amp; Trunks in the Buu arc, and Uub at the end of the series).\n\n(Source: Dragon Ball Super Exciting Character Guide)"},{"mal_id":55131,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/55131\/Houtarou_Oreki","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/15\/308148.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/15\/308148.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/15\/308148t.webp"}},"name":"Houtarou Oreki","nicknames":[],"favorites":22025,"about":"Age: 15-16\nBirthday: April 28\nHeight: 176 cm\nWeight: 62 kg\nHair color: brown\nEye color: green\nRelatives: Oreki Tomoe (sister) \nPersonality: Quiet, laid-back, lazy \nMotto: \"If I don't have to do it, I won't.

He's considered lazy and apathetic, always living on the \"gray\" side, and is not interested in any activities that might waste his time and energy. He actually never intended to join any club, but his sister ordered him to join the Classics Club to save it from being disbanded. Even though he might not seem it, he's unbelievably good at solving mysteries and seems to be able to always find a solution if he gives it a thought.

He has a recognizable attire of trenchcoat-length school uniform jacket with yellow chains on the collar.\n\nHe also wears a trademark hat which, while torn in the back, often seems to blend with his hair. While they are first shown as being completely separate, later publications cause more uncertainty as to where his hat and his hair actually meet. His hat is most likely a Japanese student cap that was normally worn along with the gakuran prior to the 1970s.\n\nHe is also known for a quick and short temper. He is the only JoJo to make an appearance in four different series.\n\nJoutarou is Holly Kuujou's son and Joseph Joestar's grandson. When Joutarou first appears, he turned himself in to the police because he believes his Stand is an evil spirit possessing him. To demonstrate, he steals a gun from a prison guard, and tries to shoot himself in the head\u2014a phantom hand emerges from his arm and catches the bullet, however, only Holly sees the hand. This act naturally earned the widespread fear of the guards and other prisoners towards him.\n\nJoseph comes to Joutarou's aid with Mohammed Avdol. A brief fight ensues due to Joutarou's defiance, getting Avdol involved. After he is released from jail, and learns what his Stand is, Joutarou gets used to Star Platinum, a fierce, muscular, vaguely Aztec-looking spirit with \"the precision of a machine\" and the ability to destroy virtually anything with a \"Fist of the North Star\"-like sledgehammer barrage of fists.\n\nIn the sixth story arc Stone Ocean, Joutarou becomes an oceanologist, moves to the United States, eventually marries, and his daughter, Jolyne inherits Stand powers. But she also inherits the tradition of adventures that Joutarou tends to get entangled in. She also adopts an outfit style similar to his at one point due to her fascination and respect for her father.\n\nHe has a very tough exterior (despite the profile image indicating nothing of the sort), and is even rather rough and delinquent, but he also is very dedicated, intense, and loyal. He is very intelligent, but usually lets his (or Star Platinum's) fists do the talking with the enemy, even though he often has to rely on his wits to deal with stand users' attacks. Joutarou has a perpetual cooler-than-thou, slightly disinterested attitude, although he loves his mother and respects his grandfather. It is not that he is unaware of his own love and\/or respect\u2014rather, he thinks anyone can tell his emotions just by looking at him, and probably thinks further effort in portraying how he feels to be a waste of time. In the manga, he's constantly chased by adoring girls, whom he ignores or tries to drive away. He is the main target of Dio, who realizes that Joutarou is his greatest threat.\n\nIn part 6, he also shows his protective father side, often taking near fatal blows for Jolyne and throttling her out of harm's way. After he is \"revived,\" Anasui, one of Jolyne's companions who is enthralled by her, asked Joutarou to approve of marrying her. Although he first acted deaf, Joutarou got the picture when he saw her lean against Anasui's chest. Not ready to see his daughter married off right away, he pulled his daughter into his arms, leaving Jolyne clueless to their interactions. His father, a jazz musician, is thought to receive his namesake from Sadao Watanabe, a jazz saxophonist. His father is always on tour and is never seen.\n\nJoutarou is both fierce and gentle, and he shows these traits in various scenes, from the fight with N'Dour to the encounter with D'Arby. One shining example is how he spared Noriaki Kakyoin, instead of destroying him outright, knowing that Kakyoin attacked him unwillingly and was under Dio's influence. The same happened for Polnareff, whom he saved as well. Both became invaluable allies to the end. Unlike with both D'Arby brothers, who got the full brunt of Joutarou's ferocity, he saw in N'Dour blind loyalty rather than greed and evil that was evident with the other enemies. Though still loyal to Dio, N'Dour respected Joutarou for his strength, despite being an enemy, until he breathed his last. In return, Joutarou gave N'Dour a decent burial in the desert.\n\nJoutarou's appearance is interesting in that he exhibits an anime archetype exhibited commonly by \"genius\" characters by forever staying young through all of his appearances in spite of age.\n\nHis catchphrase is \"Yare yare daze.\" It has no direct translation but it is usually translated to the effect of, \"Gimme a break.\" It can also mean \"Well well well...\" or \"all-right all-right...,\" since \"yare yare\" commonly translates to \"Oh well...\" It generally relates of being bored or exasperation. In the official Shonen Jump Advanced manga this is written as \"Give me a !@$&amp;*# break..\"\n\nIn the manga, Joutarou is seen reading a Shounen Jump in his cell, with Shounen Jump being the magazine in which JoJo is published in Japan. These magazines also saved Joutarou from being fatally impaled by Dio's knives.\n\nHe is regarded by many as the most charismatic character of the JoJo series.\n\nOne of the strongest stands in the JoJo universe; Star Platinum possesses super human senses, strength, stamina, accuracy and speed. It can see for great distances and at great magnifications. As an added bonus, it has a \"Star Finger\" attack in which it extends its finger to attack. It is similar to Dio's The World stand, and, it turns out, can likewise be used to stop time, but that ability is only revealed in Joutarou's epic battle with Dio Brando when Dio was about to drop a steamroller on him.\n\nThe Star card symbolizes, above all, hope. This is very appropriate, since Joutarou is very much the young new hope of the series. Like other physically powerful stands, Star Platinum suffers from a narrow range of activity. It can only be active within a 2-3 meter radius from Joutarou.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":67067,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/67067\/Yukino_Yukinoshita","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/202721.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/202721.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/202721t.webp"}},"name":"Yukino Yukinoshita","nicknames":["Yukinon"],"favorites":20925,"about":"Birthday: January 3\nBlood type: B\n\nYukino is the leader of the Service Club, of which she is the sole member until Hachiman joins her.

Revy is a Chinese-American born and raised in Chinatown, Manhattan, near Mott Street, spending most of her youth as a thief and murderer. Flashbacks throughout the series reveal that Revy may have honed her skills with firearms by shooting at cans, and that her first murder may have involved shooting an unknown man while using a pillow. It is unknown whether the pillow was used to suppress the noise or to help avoid looking at her first victim.\n\n\nRevy is very competitive, easily bored, and extremely ill-tempered. Unlike Rock, she is undiplomatic, believing in the use of brute force and coercion to get her way. In contrast to this, she's revealed to be highly ticklish.\n\nRevy is a merciless and sadistic killer, without a conscience, who will kill anyone at the slightest provocation, even unarmed civilians (as seen in episode 6). Dutch once made reference to University of Texas shooter Charles Whitman in describing Revy after she slaughtered the crew of the Neo-Nazis' boat after a previous conversation with Rock brought up some unpleasant memories, resulting in an internal fit of rage - she even threatened Rock with death if he ever questions or tampers with her way of life. Of all the characters in the series, Revy uses the most foul language. She takes maniacal glee in killing anyone and everyone. She is also a heavy smoker and drinker.\n\nShe has a changing but volatile attitude towards Rock; though she respects him later in the series, she is mostly hostile towards him. She shot Rock at point blank range, but he moved her gun at the last second, during a confrontation in episode 7, and in episode 1 emptied most of a magazine in his direction while arguing with Dutch about their hostage. However, she does have a tendency to save Rock from critical situations, and later on she admits to considering Rock as family to Balalaika. It is possible that she has an attraction to Rock, based on her reactions to Eda's teasing, which appear to be jealousy.\n\nAccording to CIA agents on Basilan Island, towards the end of episode 12, Revy is still notorious in the NYPD, particularly at the 27th Precinct. Since the 27th Precinct does not exist in real-life New York City, this throwaway reference may - or may not - indicate an odd connection to Dick Wolf's Law and Order franchise. This is further suggested in a later episode, when Revy specifically mentions the series.\n\nRevy is one of the deadliest fighters in the series, whose skill with firearms and ability to dodge bullets is almost superhuman and unparallelel. There are only a few other characters, such as Roberta and Ginji, that can hold their ground against her in combat.\n\nHer weapons of choice are a pair of modified Beretta 92FS's; which are made out of stainless steel and had their barrels extended from 4.9\" to 5.9\" each (the 5.9\" is the combat MOD barrel) and also adapted for silencers. They are engraved with \"9mm Sword Cutlass\" on both sides, as well as the Jolly Roger of the infamous pirate Calico Jack (which is also inlaid into the ivory grips), and a manufacture inscription in Thai. Due to her ambidextrous marksmanship skills, she is nicknamed \"Two Hand\" by the denizens of Roanapur. However, Revy has been seen using a variety of other firearms.\n\nConstantly living on the edge of life, Revy has developed a rather bleak, almost nihilistic outlook on life, relying only on her own power, skills, and money. She does not believe in God or emotions. However, she seems to respect and trust her companions.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":90291,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/90291\/Kusuo_Saiki","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/337932.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/337932.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/337932t.webp"}},"name":"Kusuo Saiki","nicknames":["Kusuko","Kuriko","Partner","Kuu-chan","Sai","Cyborg Sodaman Mark II"],"favorites":18785,"about":"Age: 16-17\nBirthday: August 16\nHeight: 167 cm (may vary)\nWeight: 52 kg (may vary)\nOccupation: Student\nSchool: PK Academy\nYear\/Course: 2nd year\n\nSaiki has an extremely uncaring personality.

I want to make him mine and become one with him.\"\n\nKurumi Tokisaki is the main antagonist in the series. She is the third Spirit to be encountered in the series and is the most dangerous and lethal Spirit. She is heavily obsessed with Shidou and has the ability to manipulate time. Her codename is Nightmare. She has a split personality: that of a gentle, mysterious high school girl with a slow talking pattern, and that of a psychopathic killer. Kurumi is very aggressive in her actions which makes it harder for Shidou to capture her.\n\nKurumi can be described a person whose personality is hard to read, possessing a well-polished dislike of humanity that borders on mistrust, something she shared with many Spirits in their debut. She is a skilled actress, capable of putting on the fa\u00e7ade of an innocent, curious young girl when she needs to, shown when she registered as a student at the Raizen High School, even speaking in a very polite manner; however, under that mask lies a psychotic woman, prone to fits of insane laughter that possesses no regard for human life, regarding them as a food source to restore her own time, and thus, a disposable commodity. There is a twisted justice behind her methods, however, as the people that she brutally murdered were would-be rapists and animal abusers.\nIn hindsight, Kurumi possesses some degree of innocence that her psychotic behavior have not entirely ruined; she has a soft spot for small animals and other creatures. She once slaughtered four humans not because she needed to replenish her time, but because they were trying to kill a kitten, this is the closest to a humanizing emotion that she has.\n\nMana reported that Kurumi is the most dangerous spirit known, who has personally killed over 10,000 people which does not include the spacequake's victims within that statistics. Kurumi  used unstated and unexplained methods to personally transfer into Shidou Itsuka's high school and classroom so she can get closer to him. Her purposes and reasons in this transfer are simple; consume Shidou Itsuka, in doing so gain their memories, goals, fears and obsessions. In some non-canon stories, the clone Shido seduced shows some \"independent\" attitude, almost rebellious, and openly acts lovey-dovey with Shido, which causes troubles to the \"main\" Kurumi and even leads to confrontation with her.\n\n\n\nKurumi has the ability to manipulate the 4th dimension, mainly time, but her main power is associated with controlling shadows. Shadow is her primary power while Time is her secondary power in terms of usage. Combined with the power of time, she can create a clone with all her experiences, memories, abilities, etc. These clones however are shadows of her past selves who contain feelings the current Kurumi no longer possesses, Kurumi will kill these clones if they are swayed away from her goals.\n\nThese clones are less powerful than Kurumi herself as she has mentioned in the last chapter of volume 3 and in the epilogue of volume 4. She can form a single clone by shooting herself with Zafkiel or bring out all of her clones at once from a pool of shadows which she also uses to draw them all back in and all the time they've collected. She can also call her clones partially through small fields of shadows, most often to hold someone in place and prevent them from moving.\n\nTo activate any power she needs, she first needs to call her Angel (regardless of whether or not the Angel has been summoned already or not), and to position both of her guns just like a clock: The musket on 12 and the flintlock points at the number of the bullet. Next she needs to shoot the bullet at the target with the hand gun. In case she needs it for herself, she will be required to shoot it at her head.\n\nShe also has the ability to call and dismiss spacequakes at will, as shown in the series while she confronts Shidou on the school's rooftop.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia, DAL Wiki)"},{"mal_id":14523,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/14523\/Takumi_Usui","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/282968.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/282968.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/282968t.webp"}},"name":"Takumi Usui","nicknames":["Perverted Alien"],"favorites":17293,"about":"Age: 17\\n\r\nClass: 2-2\\n\r\nBirthdate: April 27\\n\r\nHeight: 186 cm\\n\r\nWeight: Forgot\\n\r\nBlood type: O\\n\r\nSchool: Seika High School\\n\r\nSpecial skill: Everything he does\\n\r\nFavorite thing: Observing Misaki work\\n\r\nFavorite food: Porridge, Misa-chan's omelet rice and anything else she makes\\n\r\nFavorite word: Ayuzawa Misaki\\n\r\n\\n\r\nOne of the most popular boys at Seika High, Usui appears to take little interest in anything and prefers to observe things as they unfold, though proves to be extraordinarily talented in numerous areas.

When he was in the main building, due to the betrayal of his most-trusted homeroom teacher, he began to hate all people who called themselves 'teachers' and as a result has almost zero respect for any adults. He is shown to be skilled in fighting, tricky, and manipulative, and takes great pleasure in harming others. He excels at using weaponry and foul play and is one of the few students thus far to have successfully injured Korosensei.\n\nKarma has been described by Karasuma as \"at first glance, he comes across as being a lazy sort, but... there's a strong sense of mischief in his eyes.\" Karma is quite relaxed most of the time as he occasionally skips out on things he finds boring, such as the school assembly. When fighting, he becomes brutal and has no qualms of hurting people who threatens him or any of his friends from Class E.\n\nIt is also shown that he is one of the most intelligent people in the entire school, shown to be ranked 4th out of all 186 students in Kunigigaoka. He does not, however, want to return to the main building, stating that he finds assassination much more interesting.\n\nRegardless of his lazy personality, Itona has stated that Karma was probably the strongest within the class despite him not excelling in any particular area (shooting, knifework, etc). Most likely this means that Karma prefers to stick to tricks and pranks for assassinations rather than going into full-out combat, and also because of a certain \"vision\" Itona described to Terasaka. It has been mentioned by Karasuma, and proven many times, that Karma likes to humiliate his opponent.\n\nDespite all this, Karma actually has good morales behind his motives. The reason he was placed in Class E was because he had rescued a senior from Class E being bullied by students from the main building. He was, unlike his classmates, unprejudiced against them and still considered the senior a 'senpai'.\n\nHe's also shown to be hardworking when he wants to by studying diligently after the embarrassing exam arc although he hides it by making it look like he was playing video games.\n\n(Source: Assassination Classroom Wikia)"},{"mal_id":10010,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/10010\/Kiritsugu_Emiya","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/306553.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/306553.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/306553t.webp"}},"name":"Kiritsugu Emiya","nicknames":["Magus Killer","Kerry"],"favorites":15877,"about":"Birthday: November 11, 1965\nHeight: 175 cm\nWeight: 67 kg\nBlood type: AB\nServant: Saber\nClassifications: human, magus, master\nLikes: efficiency\nSpouse: \nDaughter: \nTalents: shooting, jobs involving destruction\nSidearm: Thompson Contender chambered in .30-06 Springfield, in conjunction with his Mystic Code Origin Bullets, Calico M950 submachine gun, Walther WA2000 sniper fitted with AN\/PVS4 thermal optics\nFamous quote: \"Even if I am to carry 'all the evils of this world,' it won't matter.

This is partly due to him seeking paths of least resistance, as he often chooses to do things he would otherwise not do if people nag him enough. In his free time he typically takes naps, watches clouds, and plays strategy games such as Shogi and Go. When put into a situation where he potentially needs to put effort into something, he attempts to try to find a way to avoid it such as forfeiting a battle or by pretending to be preoccupied with something else. In the instances where he can not avoid these situations, Shikamaru tends to remark \"how troublesome.\"\n\nDespite his lazy tendencies, Shikamaru is extremely intelligent. His teacher, Asuma, found Shikamaru to have an IQ of over 200, and learned that Shikamaru's poor grades were a result of him finding lifting a pencil to be too much work for him. Nevertheless, Shikamaru works very well with his teammates, as their fathers were teamed together in their youth. Of his teammates, Shikamaru is closest with Chouji, who repays Shikamaru's confidence in him with unyielding loyalty. Shikamaru also has a strong bond with Asuma, often spending time with him playing strategy games. After Asuma's death, he even vows to protect Asuma and Kurenai's unborn child for his teacher's sake. Shikamaru has stated that he will make the child his apprentice someday.\n\nOne of Shikamaru's more distinctive characteristics is that he finds all women to be bossy and \"a pain.\" Contrary to this opinion, he has expressed a notably mature interest in marriage and raising a family with a son and daughter. Ironically, Shikamaru seems to constantly find himself surrounded by the very same strong-willed and bossy women he dislikes. In addition to his own mother, and being surrounded by bossy females, he usually ends up fighting against such women. Shikamaru has had a number of his appearances coincide with those of Temari. When they make their Part II debut together, Naruto Uzumaki asks if they are on a date, though both Shikamaru and Temari state that this is not the case.\n\nWhen the need arises, Shikamaru is quick to abandon his lazy nature and act appropriately to complete a mission or save his teammates. Using his Shadow Imitation Technique, the signature technique of his clan, he can capture the shadow of an opponent to either keep them immobilized or force them to mimic his movements. This ability causes Shikamaru to frequently take the task of stalling enemies so that his comrades can get to safety or to simply buy time. Although this role puts him in a dangerous position once he can no longer stall the opponent, Shikamaru is willing to serve it, feeling that sacrificing his life to ensure the safety of his friends is worth it. He then considers every element that is relevant to the situation at hand and analyzes the information to its fullest, planning out a battle ten moves in advance and devising over a hundred strategies to use against an opponent. This combination of intelligence and dedication to his teammates causes Shikamaru to become the first of the primary Konoha Genin to advance to the rank of Chunin.\n\nOnce becoming a Chunin, Shikamaru's father teaches him how to use his shadow technique more effectively, by using it to choke an opponent. This more interactive capability with his shadow is put to great use over the timeskip, and by Part II Shikamaru becomes proficient at using multiple shadow-based techniques at once. He is also able to manipulate his shadow to lift from the ground and either grab or throw weapons simply by utilizing an opponent's shadow for the same purpose. After he comes into the possession of Asuma's brass knuckles, Shikamaru learns to channel his shadow into them, using them to immobilize opponents by throwing them at an opponent's shadow to capture them and save himself the energy."},{"mal_id":2007,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/2007\/Shikamaru_Nara","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/3\/131315.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/3\/131315.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/3\/131315t.webp"}},"name":"Shikamaru Nara","nicknames":["Shadow Boy"],"favorites":15807,"about":"Age: 12 (I); 15 (II)\nBirthday: September 22\nHoroscope: Virgo\nBlood Type: AB\nHeight: 170 cm\nWeight: 53.4 kg\nRank: Genin (I); Chuunin (II)\nLikes: taking naps, playing shogi\nDislikes: Hard-boiled eggs\n\nShikamaru is an extremely unenthusiastic person, and as such lives his life avoiding work.

His teacher, Asuma, found Shikamaru to have an IQ of over 200, and learned that Shikamaru's poor grades were a result of him finding lifting a pencil to be too much work for him. Nevertheless, Shikamaru works very well with his teammates, as their fathers were teamed together in their youth. Of his teammates, Shikamaru is closest with Chouji, who repays Shikamaru's confidence in him with unyielding loyalty. Shikamaru also has a strong bond with Asuma, often spending time with him playing strategy games. After Asuma's death, he even vows to protect Asuma and Kurenai's unborn child for his teacher's sake. Shikamaru has stated that he will make the child his apprentice someday.\n\nOne of Shikamaru's more distinctive characteristics is that he finds all women to be bossy and \"a pain.\" Contrary to this opinion, he has expressed a notably mature interest in marriage and raising a family with a son and daughter. Ironically, Shikamaru seems to constantly find himself surrounded by the very same strong-willed and bossy women he dislikes. In addition to his own mother, and being surrounded by bossy females, he usually ends up fighting against such women. Shikamaru has had a number of his appearances coincide with those of Temari. When they make their Part II debut together, Naruto Uzumaki asks if they are on a date, though both Shikamaru and Temari state that this is not the case.\n\nWhen the need arises, Shikamaru is quick to abandon his lazy nature and act appropriately to complete a mission or save his teammates. Using his Shadow Imitation Technique, the signature technique of his clan, he can capture the shadow of an opponent to either keep them immobilized or force them to mimic his movements. This ability causes Shikamaru to frequently take the task of stalling enemies so that his comrades can get to safety or to simply buy time. Although this role puts him in a dangerous position once he can no longer stall the opponent, Shikamaru is willing to serve it, feeling that sacrificing his life to ensure the safety of his friends is worth it. He then considers every element that is relevant to the situation at hand and analyzes the information to its fullest, planning out a battle ten moves in advance and devising over a hundred strategies to use against an opponent. This combination of intelligence and dedication to his teammates causes Shikamaru to become the first of the primary Konoha Genin to advance to the rank of Chunin.\n\nOnce becoming a Chunin, Shikamaru's father teaches him how to use his shadow technique more effectively, by using it to choke an opponent. This more interactive capability with his shadow is put to great use over the timeskip, and by Part II Shikamaru becomes proficient at using multiple shadow-based techniques at once. He is also able to manipulate his shadow to lift from the ground and either grab or throw weapons simply by utilizing an opponent's shadow for the same purpose. After he comes into the possession of Asuma's brass knuckles, Shikamaru learns to channel his shadow into them, using them to immobilize opponents by throwing them at an opponent's shadow to capture them and save himself the energy."},{"mal_id":143185,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/143185\/Yuu_Ishigami","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/7\/372840.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/7\/372840.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/7\/372840t.webp"}},"name":"Yuu Ishigami","nicknames":[],"favorites":15616,"about":"He is the treasurer of the student council of the Shuchiin Academy."},{"mal_id":61,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/61\/Robin_Nico","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/136773.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/136773.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/136773t.webp"}},"name":"Robin Nico","nicknames":["Devil Child","Miss All Sunday"],"favorites":15388,"about":"Age: 28; 30\nBirthdate: February 6, Aquarius\nHeight: 188cm (6'2\") \nSizes: 99 - 59 - 89\nAffiliation: Straw Hat Pirates (previously; Baroque Works)\nPosition: Archaeologist\nDevil Fruit: Hana Hana no Mi (Flower Flower Fruit)\nType: Paramecia\nBounty: \nRobin is the seventh member of Straw Hat's Crew. She had a bounty of 79 million beri (One Piece currency)  since she was eight years old, during an incident in which she supposedly destroyed six Buster Call ships through the use of the powers she gained by the eating the Hana Hana no Mi (Flower Flower or Blooming Blooming Fruit). The fruit's power enables her to conjure up multiple replicas of her body parts (most often her arms) upon any surface she is able to see making her very powerful and dexterous as a result. \n\nRobin joined the Straw Hat Pirates after Luffy saved her life, or (how she states it) Luffy forced her to live when she wanted to die.

Although feared at first, she is quickly accepted and viewed as a comrade by the crew.\n\nRobin is actually an archaeologist of talent, and despises anyone who thoughtlessly damages any piece of history.

She often only speaks when something interesting or important has happened. She loves to study history, and the comfort and freedom to study and read. She is also quick to point out gross or realistically morbid facts, often creeping out Nami or Usopp. Robin is the wisest and most sensible member of the crew. She has a vast knowledge of the seas and the world, and usually keeps her head during surprising situations, allowing her to logically analyze the situation without losing her cool. This trait makes her different from the other Straw Hats, who often comically react melodramatically to unexpected happenings and hold irrational ideas and conclusions.

In the series, she is introduced declaring her interests in aliens, espers and time travelers and does not care for \"ordinary\" human beings. The last thing on her mind is a normal high school life. With a burning desire to find such phenomena in the world, she is generally unapproachable and finds ordinary people boring and uninteresting. As a result of this, many of her classmates choose to avoid and confront her. She deals with her emotions by creating a parallel universe, where she inadvertently releases transparent creatures who tear up and destroy everything that comes into contact with them. Espers are the ones who can stop these creatures by cutting and destroying them, because if these creatures are left alone destroying everything as well as the outer barrier it could affect the outside world. She also likes to dress up Mikuru in random outfits.\n\nKyon is the first character to engage with her in a serious conversation. From this encounter, she gradually begins to soften up to others and starts to open up with her classmates. Later on, Haruhi took Kyon against his will and forced him to help her start the SOS Brigade, thus she has taken an unknown interests to Kyon later in the series. It is hinted that one of the reasons as to why Haruhi opened up to Kyon was that he resembled John Smith; John Smith and Kyon are the same person.\n\nShe is noted as smart, athletic, and naturally talented in any extra-curricular activities. She once joined every activity club in her school and quit because she found them boring, despite pleas by the club members for her membership. Her musical talent was highlighted when she stood in as the emergency lead singer and guitarist, along with Yuki, for the band ENOZ during the school festival.\n\n\n\nPersonality\nAt first, Haruhi seems very indifferent and cold but underneath that front she is very spontaneous, upbeat, and hyperactive. Her determination, persistence, and resourcefulness drive her endeavors of finding strange phenomenon and promoting the SOS Brigade. Because of her dedication, she becomes hot-headed when things don't go her way. Hand-in-hand with her cleverness and creativity, and a certain ruthlessness, even seeming amorality, she can often get what she wants, an example of such is when she blackmailed the Computer Society President into giving her a brand new computer for the SOS Brigade. Haruhi tends to pursue her goals regardless of who gets in the way, or is hurt, such as Mikuru in the aforementioned blackmail. She also has a tendency to be jealous and angry when Kyon gets too friendly with any girl. Evidently, the universe was almost destroyed and recreated when Haruhi's jealousy was pushed too far.\n\nHaruhi also has a very competitive personality and accepts without hesitation any challenge that crosses her, regardless of difficulty or time constraint. Her constant optimism and over-confidence make her seem arrogant. She has very high standards and won't accept anything less than perfection from herself and her Brigade. She places a lot of trust in her Brigade members, especially Kyon, to get the task done whatever it may be. This can sometimes make her seem selfish and unkind.\n\nShe is not shy and often attracts a lot of attention to the point of not minding changing clothes in front of various people, more so when her SOS Brigade is in mind. When it comes to Mikuru she is very physically playful. She often comments on Mikuru's attractiveness and seems to find a kind of enjoyment in exploiting it to her own ends, often through forcing Mikuru into and out of various costumes such as a bunny girl costume as if she were a human dress-up doll.\n\n\n\nSOS Brigade role\nHaruhi is the founder and \"Brigade Chief\" of the SOS Brigade, or Saving The World by Overloading it with Fun Haruhi Suzumiya Brigade. She was unable to find any existing club suitable to her preferences. She made the group in order to find and have fun with aliens, espers, and time travelers. Upon creation, she names herself as its leader. Her method of finding and recruiting members is to \"voluntarily arrest\" them then force them to join.\n\nThe SOS Brigade is very precious to her and has stated to Kyon that she has no intention of yielding her position as Chief to anyone else. She will go to any lengths, even by exploiting the members, to bring attention and support for her Brigade such as procuring room and materials, maintaining their website, participating in sports tournaments, organizing activities such as city-wide searches for strange phenomenon among other things. She wrote, produced, and directed the Brigade's amateur-movie The Adventures of Mikuru Asahina for the school festival."},{"mal_id":719,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/719\/Johan_Liebert","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/316522.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/316522.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/316522t.webp"}},"name":"Johan Liebert","nicknames":["Johan Liebheart","Monster"],"favorites":14982,"about":"Johan Liebert is the namesake \"monster\" of the story and the mystery of his past is the focus of the plot.

She can be smart, but she hates studying, thus her grades are a bit uneasy. However, she is an expert in pulling an \"all-nighter.\" In contrast to her studying habits, she loves video games, to the extent that she can compete against Kagami Hiiragi on trivia games (by remembering the question orders, not by knowing the actual answers). In addition, she loves anime, which is also due to her father, Soujirou Izumi's influence, along with the games. He buys ero-games for himself, so she is able to play and enjoy them. In fact, when she became eighteen, Konata was overjoyed, since she could now go buy and play ero-games legally. In the anime, Konata constantly refers to or parodies several popular games, anime, and manga (much to the annoyance of Kagami), but her favorite franchise seems to be the Haruhi series, as she has many Haruhi figurines and decorations that makes her room, and even once went to the Suzumiya Haruhi no Gekisou with her friends. She often gives false information to her family, thus making her father believe that Kagami and Tsukasa are shrine maidens. Interestingly enough, her voice actress for the animated version, Aya Hirano and Wendee Lee, is in fact the same person who voiced Haruhi Suzumiya in The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya anime; other voice actors from the same series make guest appearances during the course of Lucky \u2606 Star.\n\nSince she spends quite a large sum of money on video games and doujinshi, Konata was lucky enough to get a part-time job at a cosplay cafe.

Her significant other in the game is coincidently a male gamer using a female character.

He ruled the Sumerian city-state of Uruk, the capital city of ancient Mesopotamia in the B.C. era. He was an ultimate, transcendent being so divine as to be two thirds god and one third human, and no others in the world could match him. He was a despot possessing high divinity who believed he was invincible. He is not merely a legend, and is said to have actually existed and ruled during the Sumer Dynasty five thousand years ago. He was the King of Heroes who possessed all things in the world, whose tale is recorded in mankind's oldest epic poem, the Epic of Gilgamesh which portrays Gilgamesh as a hero, destined to be king and achieve great feats, who is driven to meet his destiny, facing challenges together with his best friend Enkidu.\n\nHis title, King of Heroes, is not meant to call him a king who is a hero, but instead implies that he is the king over all heroes. He is mankind's oldest hero, the origin of all myths and model on which heroes are based, so his story is copied within the mythologies of all the countries of the world. The heroes of various myths are derived from his legend, so his Gate of Babylon possesses all of their Noble Phantasms.

He was born in Jiiha Village and was raised by his parents until the age of seven, when his parents were killed in an underground avalanche caused by an earthquake. Their deaths traumatized Simon to the point of both hating and fearing life underground, and likely played a role in developing his relationship with Kamina. Ironically, Simon's role in his community was to dig more tunnels and caverns to expand Jiiha Village deeper underground.\n\nThough valued as a skilled digger, Simon was ignored by the adults of his village and snubbed by the girls, who considered him disgusting. Along with his fear of earthquakes, Simon developed low self-esteem and had many cowardly tendencies. His only friend and role model growing up was Kamina, a brash and eccentric older boy who had an obsession with escaping the underground world for the surface, which he visited as a child with his father. Simon was slowly \"recruited\" into Team Gurren along with several other boys, and lead by Kamina made several attempts to reach the surface over several years. During one attempt, a sudden earthquake trapped Team Gurren within a chamber and cut off the supply of oxygen. Simon began to panic, but after inspiration from Kamina he managed to dig all of the Team Gurren members out of danger. Yoko would later recall that Kamina himself was terrified during this incident, but he hid his fear from Simon knowing Simon was the only one capable of rescuing his gang.\n\nOne day during the digging of a new tunnel, Simon discovers a small drill-shaped object that periodically glows. Later that day, he unearths a large \"face\" in the ground, which he shows to Yoko and Kamina after Jiiha Village is attacked by a large Gunmen. The face is revealed to be a miniature Gunmen, and the object Simon dug up the key to starting it up. With the aid of this mech, which Kamina names \"Lagann\", Simon destroys the large Gunmen attacking Jiiha and rises to the surface world.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":118733,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/118733\/Sakuta_Azusagawa","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/398261.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/398261.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/398261t.webp"}},"name":"Sakuta Azusagawa","nicknames":[],"favorites":13477,"about":"Gender: Male\nAge: 16-17\nBirthday: April 10 (Aries)\nHeight: 5'7\" (172 cm)\nOccupation: Student\nAffiliation: Minegahara High School, 2nd year\n\nSakuta Azusagawa (\u6893\u5ddd \u54b2\u592a, Azusagawa Sakuta) is the main male protagonist of Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai series.

She has a younger sister named Ui, who is very mature and acts as the \"older sister\" of Yui, taking care of her while their parents are away on business trips.

At school, she has become quite admired for her great voice. However, she has been shown to forget her lyrics mid-performance on at least one occasion and exert herself too much, making her unable to perform sometimes.

She uses D'Addario EXL160M medium bass strings. Her bass is given the name Elizabeth later in the anime. While she originally intended to join the literary club, she was forced into the light music club by her childhood friend and the club's president\/drummer, Ritsu. She gets excellent grades in school and is often mature and strict especially where Ritsu is involved; her weakness is the macabre and horrific, and she is often incapacitated with fear when stories involving ghosts, blood, injuries, haunted houses, barnacles or other disturbing topics come up. She also has a fear of being in the spotlight and gets embarrassed easily, and is often subject to teasing from Ritsu and Sawako, their club adviser and eventual third-year homeroom teacher. Mio has long, straight black hair and gray eyes (that are angled slightly more than the other characters). She cites that she chose bass since it is not the center of attention in the band, unlike the guitarist. Mio is more technical when it comes to music, and Yui often comes to her when she is in need of more guitar tutorials.\n\nAlong with Yui, Mio is one of the band's main vocalists, though given her dislike of being center stage, she tries to avoid taking the lead vocal if possible, generally singing if Yui is unable to. She writes most of the songs, although they usually feature some odd and overly girlish lyrics like \"Light and Fluffy Time.\" As she is left-handed, she becomes entranced whenever she sees left-handed instruments, because of their rarity. After their first live performance, the attractive Mio gained a huge fan following (in no small part due to an unfortunate accident that occurred at the end of the show), led by an infatuated former student council president. Also resulting from her sudden popularity, most of her classmates voted that she portray Romeo in their class play.

Possibly one of the best (or even the best) navigators currently sailing the Grand Line, she has the ability to recognize and analyze even the slightest changes in the weather through sheer intuition, thus saving the ship and the crew from the very unstable Grand Line weather on multiple occasions.\n\nNami has a tattoo on her left shoulder (a homage to her past), where she used to have a shark tattoo for being a member of Arlong's Crew. The new tattoo represents mikan (a fruit commonly know as tangerine) and pinwheels.\n\nShe respects Luffy's qualities as a leader, but often gets angry of his irrational thinking and short attention span, even so she trusts him with her life. Despite the fact that Nami has deceived the crew, Luffy still trusts her enough to allow her to safe-keep his precious straw hat. She is almost always the one who gives orders on the ship (much to the Zoro's resentment) because of Luffy's usual lack of common sense. She often comically beats or hits her other crewmates for their nonsense, which occurs quite often. Robin is actually the only person Nami doesn't try to boss, and she referred to her as the only person who understands her, though in a comical fashion. She is very manipulative as well and can even turn an entire conversation in her favor when necessary, often putting on disguises and tricking the enemy. Acting as the \"mother\" of the crew, Nami doesn't understand or approve of the boys' often macho attitudes and principles. These are the only situations where Nami doesn't get the final word.\n\nNami's two favorite things are money and tangerines. She is greedy and will do anything, aside from abandoning or killing her friends, for money. Due to her past - After having gathered money for 8 years (and even before that often stole things), Nami is naturally accustomed to it, but thinks of her friends as more important. She is very manipulative, and often takes advantage of Sanji for his devotion to her and Usopp to maintain her weapons. Roronoa Zoro tries not to fall for her schemes, but ends up a victim like the rest, usually due to debt and blackmail. Nami also tries to avoid fights, and is one of the less adventurous and brave members of the crew. However, since the invention of her Clima Tact (A weapon that forms weather patterns), she is now seen fighting her own battles instead of becoming the 'easy target,' as she doesn't want to be the one being saved anymore."},{"mal_id":1259,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/1259\/Misato_Katsuragi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/79482.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/79482.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/79482t.webp"}},"name":"Misato Katsuragi","nicknames":[],"favorites":12573,"about":"Age: 29\nBirthday: December 8, 1986\nBlood type: A (genotype: AO)\nHeight: 163 cm\n\nRelations:\nFather: Dr. Katsuragi\nGuardian of: Shinji Ikari, Asuka Langley Soryu\nEx-girlfriend of: Ryoji Kaji\nFriend of: Ritsuko Akagi\nOwner of: Pen Pen\n\nMisato Katsuragi is the chief operations officer at NERV, initially holding the rank of Captain (with a later promotion to Major).

He loves to tell tall tales to Chopper (who believes him blindly) or anyone who's listening. The other aspect of Usopp besides his lying is his cowardice; he is a very timid person, or so he thinks. In extremely stressful situations, Usopp has proven to be far more courageous than he believes himself to be. He shows great resolve when his friends are threatened or mocked by outsiders. Even though he is a complete coward in battle (except as his alter ego, Sogeking), he is a useful part to the Straw Hat Pirates. He is extremely handy and can fix almost anything. He sometimes sees a role model in Zoro who never seems afraid but always proud. Usopp lacks a bit of self esteem and is often taken advantage of by Nami to make her weapons or repair and improve them - something he is very adept at, having constructed the ingenious weapon \"Clima Tact.\"\n\nUsopp will also stand up and fight for not only the well-being of people, but also for their ideals - and the ideals of a pirate, which he holds very high. In battle he normally tries to trick his enemy by telling tales or mischievous lies to deceive them. Despite his lack of physical strength compared to other members of the crew, Usopp seems to be just as resilient as his comrades and this ability to bear loads and loads of damage, is one of his best traits, in addition to his cunning and intelligence, which has saved the Straw Hats on many occasions.

His original name was Shinta (\u5fc3\u592a).  His parents died of cholera when he was very young and as a result, was adopted by three slave women in a traveling slave wagon.  Soon after meeting them, bandits had raided the convoy and killed his three new guardians and were about to kill him when a man named Seijuro Hiko killed the bandits. Hiko soon adopted the child and because Shinta was not a name fitted for a swordman, he renamed him Kenshin, meaning \"Heart of Sword,\" took him under his wing and taught him the Hiten Mitsuruugi Ryu.\n\n\nThe next time Kenshin is seen is 10 years later as he has become a wanderer who helps out anyone in need who is suffering right before his eyes.  Those long 10 years have taken him from Kyoto, all over Japan to where we find him in episode one of the anime, in Tokyo, still keeping his vow never to kill again.

However, they are also the Queen's watchdogs; the Phantomhive family keeps an eye on black market dealings in ways that Scotland Yard isn't able to. Ciel Phantomhive is the heir to this legacy.\n\nEarl Ciel Phantomhive is the business-savvy, twelve-year-old (later thirteen-year-old) head of the English Phantomhive noble family, taking over after the deaths of his parents, Lord Vincent and Lady Rachel Phantomhive. He also runs Funtom Company, which manufactures toys and sweets, and later adds a food branch after winning a Royal Warrant. His right eye, which is usually covered with a black eyepatch, bears a pentacle sign of the Faustian contract which binds the demon Sebastian Michaelis to his will. He also has a brand burnt into his back from when he was sold as a slave after his house was burnt down.\n\nCiel is engaged to his cousin, Elizabeth Midford. He sees her as an important friend and someone he needs to protect. His parents were killed and his mansion was set ablaze on his birthday, a reason why he does not like to celebrate the occasion. This tragedy causes him to not want to lose anyone important again.\n\nDespite his young age, he runs the family company and, as such, is quite busy much of the time though he still finds time to go out investigating dubious legal matters.\n\nThroughout the series Ciel's height has been used as a tool of mockery due to his short stature. He grows by 6 cm in the second season, but still remains shorter than the other characters, thus continuing the comical relief. Sebastian enjoys teasing Ciel about this fact. In the manga, he does not grow taller.\n\nThe young earl is far more composed and mature than would be expected. He remains distant from others, aloof, preferring to spend his time on work for the company.  He is oftentimes selfish and not able to fully empathize with people. However, he does express occasional concern for the well-being of those close to him.\n\nAs a side note, Ciel seems to enjoy drinking tea a lot (he is adept at distinguishing between them as well) and sweet desserts. He has asthma (inherited from his mother) and dislikes being around cats because they trigger his allergies.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":116281,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/116281\/Momonga","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/3\/288006.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/3\/288006.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/3\/288006t.webp"}},"name":"Momonga","nicknames":["Ainz Ooal Gown","Momon"],"favorites":10835,"about":"Ainz Ooal Gown (\u30a2\u30a4\u30f3\u30ba\u30fb\u30a6\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30b4\u30a6\u30f3), formerly known as Momonga (\u30e2\u30e2\u30f3\u30ac), is the main protagonist of the Overlord series.

District #80 is the worst, most lawless region of Rukongai, full of thieves and murderers (whereas area #1 is the most orderly and law-abiding). While residing in District #80, Kenpachi was nameless. During that time, he became proficient in swordsmanship and killed numerous enemies.\n\nAt some point during his travels outside of District #80, he found a small girl and named her Yachiru (\u516b\u5343\u6d41), in remembrance of the only person he ever admired, after she showed no fear of his sword. Yachiru came from area #79, Kusajishi (\u8349\u9e7f), where her parents were murdered. The two events were apparently quite close. On that day, he also took on a name: Kenpachi, the title bestowed upon the strongest swordsman, the one who has killed the most. The two developed a father-daughter-like relationship.\n\nAlso, at some point (before he became a Captain), he fought and defeated Ikkaku Madarame; for this reason, Ikkaku pledged to serve under Kenpachi from there on out (Ikkaku doesn't actually get the chance to do so until he joins the 11th Division), but Ikkaku would still jump at the chance to fight Kenpachi to the death.\n\nAfter some time had passed, Kenpachi found his way to the Seireitei. He defeated and killed the previous Captain of the 11th Division (whose identity is currently unknown) and gained his seat in the Gotei 13 in this manner. In the anime, his assumption of the Captain's seat caused Maki Ichinose to leave the Soul Society. According to the anime, it is also what convinced Ikkaku and Yumichika to join the Shinigami.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":127764,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/127764\/Yami_Sukehiro","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/6\/338843.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/6\/338843.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/6\/338843t.webp"}},"name":"Yami Sukehiro","nicknames":["Destruction God"],"favorites":10674,"about":"Age: 28-29\nHeight: 183 cm\nBirthday: September 17\nSign: Virgo\nBlood Type: O\nLikes: Cigarettes, intimidation, interesting people\n\nYami is a large man with a muscular build, wild brown hair with the front brushed back, small eyes, a mustache, stubs on his chin, and a thick neck.

He was abandoned by his biological parents because of the supposed \"deformity\" of his left arm (which was later revealed to be caused by his Innocence). He was eventually found and adopted by a traveling performer named Mana Walker on Christmas Day. Some time later Mana died, and Allen, tormented with grief and manipulated by the Millennium Earl, turned Mana into an Akuma, hoping that his beloved surrogate father would be fully resurrected. But the Mana Akuma cursed Allen and sliced through his left eye, leaving the \"Pentacle\" \u2014 the mark of the Akuma \u2014 which scars the left side of his face. This enabled his left eye to see the souls trapped within the Akuma from then on. It was at this same moment that Allen's left arm first invoked as an Anti-Akuma weapon, which instinctively destroyed the Mana Akuma. During the course of this traumatic event, Allen's hair turned from brown into a stark white.\n\nAllen eventually meets Cross Marian, a General of the Black Order, who explained to Allen the ways of the Akuma and the trapped souls within them: Once a soul becomes trapped inside an Akuma, they are trapped forever; and that the only way to save one is to exorcise them from their Akuma vessel. Allen subsequently became Cross' disciple and spent the next three years with him before being sent to the Black Order to become an official exorcist. During this time, Allen was tormented by his master's constant irresponsible behavior and forced into various odd-jobs to pay off the debts that General Cross accumulated. This, coupled with Marian's womanizing ways and harsh treatment towards Allen, led to Walker fearing more than respecting his master whom he never speaks fondly of. \n\nAbilities\n\nIn addition to being physically fit and skilled at combat (as evident by his ability to fight and dodge Fou without the use of his Innocence), Allen has a few odd talents and skills. Because of the many debts Allen was forced into paying by Cross, he learned to play cards and gamble at a very young age, though his initial purpose was to practice his numb deformed left hand. He also learned how to cheat and win through deception and doesn't hesitate to use these tactics whenever necessary. In fact, he is quite proud of his talents. This is a stark contrast to his polite and courteous nature and often surprises his friends who wouldn't expect such a dark side to Allen and has caused them to wonder just what Cross has done to him. Walker also possesses circus abilities such as juggling and acrobatics, which he learned from traveling with Mana who was himself a circus clown by trade.\n\nAllen's synchronization ratio reached a maximum of 83% before having his Innocence destroyed  Yet unknown to Allen, the Innocence lingered around as a hazy fog of particles; at the time, a direct reflection of his shattered state of mind. It wasn't until he came to an epiphany that he was able to seize control of his Anti-Akuma weapon once again and achieving his Innocence's true, fully-invoked form. When not activated, his arm is black and meets with his shoulder in a spiraling pattern that ends with tattoo-like emblem. Following this, the Order gave it the official designation of Crowned Clown (\u795e\u30ce\u9053\u5316\uff08\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30fb\u30af\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\uff09, Kuraun Kuraun), due to its jester-like appearance when invoked. The kanji used in the name literally translates to God's Clown (\u795e\u30ce\u9053\u5316, Kami no Douke).\n\nWhen invoked, Crowned Clown acts as a body-armored Innocence, forming a white-hooded cowl and sleeve of Innocence energy which covers his shoulders and right arm, while his left arm and hand become slender and black, clad in armor and razor sharp claws. A masquerade-style mask is always affixed to the cowl, which takes on various configurations and appearances. This transformation also changes Allen's usual hairstyle from flat to a spiky rear. As before, his Innocence possesses a certain degree of sentience, but as Crowned Crown is able to manipulate Allen's entire body like a marionette when incapacitated, or simply assisting in evasive tactics.\n\nWhen facing Tyki yet again, Allen synchronization with his Innocence exceeded 100% which activated his new Crowned Crown ability, Sword of Exorcism. The Sword of Exorcism has the ability to exorcist an Akuma on touch and even the ability to exorcist the Noah Gene from Noah's themselves. What shocked Tyki the most wasn't the ability of the sword but rather the similarity between Allen's Sword of Exorcism and the Millennium Earl's sword.\n\nStory\n\nInspector Levrier and Cross have both referred to a \"player\" (as in one who plays a musical instrument), and Cross has hinted that there may be more than one."},{"mal_id":13917,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/13917\/Accelerator","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/207883.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/207883.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/207883t.webp"}},"name":"Accelerator","nicknames":["Ippou Tsuukou","One-Way Road","Vector Change"],"favorites":10448,"about":"Age: 15-16\nHeight: 168 cm\nHair color: white\nEye color: red\nClassification: Esper\nAffiliation: GROUP (Former operative)\nOccupation: Nagatenjouki Academy\nLevel: 5\nPartner: Last Order\nAbility: One-Way Road\nQuote: \"Just because I've gotten weaker, it doesn't mean that you got stronger, right?\"\nTheme Song: \"Saikyou no Nanori\"\n\nAccelerator is the most powerful Psychic in Academy City and the main protagonist of Toaru Kagaku no Accelerator.

This ability allows Accelerator perform feats such as reversing the blood flow inside a person's body, increasing the wind velocity around him to create a massive plasma storm, and blocking sound. His ability is automatic, which means that he must consciously allow gravity to affect him and that his body blocks all ultraviolet radiation, resulting his albino appearance (white hair and pale skin) because his body is unable to make melanin. The automatic nature of Redirection also prevents the use of projectiles (like bullets) and explosives (like bombs) against him.\n\nAccelerator's unique ability made him the subject of an experiment attempting to create the first Level 6 ESPer; according to the city's best supercomputer, Tree Diagram (which was unprecedentedly destroyed by Index's Dragon Breath), this feat could only be achieved by killing 128 skilled Level 5 ESPer without a single failure. Since there are only six other known Level 5s in Academy City, an alternative plan was formed to \"level up\" Accelerator by having him kill 20,000 skilled Level 3 ESPers: the Misaka clones.

He was born from a fragment of Shinigami's soul.\n\nBeing the son of Shinigami, Kid was singled out. The other students at Shibusen were afraid to get close to him not only because he was Shinigami's son, but because they were afraid that they'd get hurt. This continued until he became the meister of Liz and Patti. They became good comrades, and even helped Kid. Kid didn't, necessarily, experience friendship until he met the others. He is really grateful to have friends that are not afraid of him like the others at Shibusen.\n\nKid has obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, or OCPD, which is manifested as an obsession over perfection. Objects and surroundings that are symmetrical can distract him from missions, and he will usually start to break down and have fits if he notices asymmetrical objects around him. Thus if anything is wrong by any measurement (a picture frame crooked, or not folding his toilet paper, for example), he will try to correct it right away, even at the cost of the mission at hand. He is so obsessed with symmetry that Kid refuses to fight a battle unless everything is symmetrical, as he would be asymmetrical holding only one gun. Even if an enemy is symmetrical in appearance, he will refuse to fight it and harm its symmetry. The fact that the left half of his bangs is marked with three white stripes causes him much stress. As a result of his OCPD, Kid can be very hard on himself if the asymmetry of the stripes in his hair are pointed out by someone, calling himself \"useless asymmetrical garbage\". Kid, trying to make himself completely symmetrical, tried to dye his hair once, but the Sanzu Lines continued to reappear. This is because his reaper body rejects all forms of chemicals and toxins, including artificial coloring like hair dye. The Index of the Book of Eibon referred to this obsession as Madness of Order.\n\nHis favorite number is 8, not only for its symmetry, but for the fact it divides out evenly. An example of one of his fits, and his love for the number 8, can be shown when he met Soul on his first day of DWMA. When Soul said that if Kid had arrived at 7 like he was suppose to he could look around himself. Instead of focusing on the entire comment.. Kid replied \"  \"No, it can't be seven! Say eight, dammit! Eight is better! It's physically impossible to cut the number seven in half and make it symmetrical! It has to be eight instead! Eight cut vertically or horizontally stays perfectly symmetrical! Take it back, I beg of you! Please say eight! Please!\", only to become further distressed when Black Star broke one of the spikes tips jutting out of his fathers, perfectly symmetrical, school.\n\nDespite that his father wears a completely asymmetrical cloak, Kid is not bothered by it at all, being that his love for his father outweighs his OCPD. He also doesn't seem to mind that his Death God Martial Art- \"Stance of Sin\" requires him to hold his arms in asymmetrical position. Showing that there are some things he can tolerate.\n\nHe is usually very mature and precise in his ways. Kid is naturally calm and collected, and as such is perfectly fine with other people making their own decisions when it comes to symmetry or otherwise, even if he disagrees with their choices. However, there are times when his obsession with symmetry can greatly affect his usually calm personality and cause him to break down into childish fits.\n\nDue to his serious personality, Kid is unaffected by nudity. While other male characters get nose bleeds, Kid does not. During a battle with a female \"madness clown\" who was trying to distract Kid with her nearly naked body, Patti says, \"Kid-kun is one of those perverts that gets distracted only when you make him rub your breasts! This won't affect him!\", but isn't actually because he is not a pervert, and is more matured than boys his age. Considering Patti is not the smartest person in the world she would think like this. When Kid had to return to DWMA, in order to get back to the fight on the moon sooner, Kid had no problems walking in the girls bathroom to help, only to be dragged out by Liz. Later in the Death Room, Kid is shown to have blood coming out of one side of his nose and mouth, having been punched by either Liz or Kim.\n\nOf course, Kid's being unaffected by nudity may also be the result of being A-Sexual. Given that his father created both him and Asura A-sexually, and Shinigami shows no interest in either gender, even when Spirit hired Blair and her friends to entertain them during their meeting, he showed no interest and was rather confused by their flirtation and later angry at them for goofing off when they should be discussing the rescue of his son. An example to prove this is when Kid had visited Soul and Maka's apartment, when Blair's towel fell off instead of getting a nosebleed like Soul or Black Star, Kid looked rather disgusted.\n\nHe doesn't seem to have any problem socializing and genuinely cares for his friends. He is seen expressing concern about Soul's scar at one point, and threatens Gopher that he will never forgive him if he hurts Maka after Gopher threatens to hurt her in revenge for their original fight. He also threw Patti and Liz away from him before being sucked into the Book of Eibon, not wanting them to be taken with him.\n\nKid generally seems to be somewhat introverted, often working on missions on his own and not having as close of a friendship with Maka or Black\u2606Star as Maka and Black\u2606Star have with each other.\n\nIt is mentioned by Maka that it is normally hard to match soul wavelengths with more than one weapon, but Kid as a highly skilled Meister is able to do so since Liz and Patti have a strong connection with each other and admiration for Kid who gave them a better life.\n\nHis father, Death, has mentioned that Kid is a Shinigami (\"death god\") and does not need to collect souls, but Kid says he wants to make a weapon of his own specifications. His father also says that since he uses two weapons and the guns do not count as a set, he will have to collect twice as many souls: 198 evil human souls and two Witch souls instead of 99 souls and one witch soul. However, he seems perfectly fine with this.\n\nKid shares a side rivalry with Black\u2606Star, and seems to be stronger, however it is possible that he is more susceptible to madness than Black\u2606Star or Maka, for both were able to pull themselves from madness while he quickly succumbed to the Madness of Order in the Book of Eibon, while Black\u2606Star is able to quickly snap himself out of it. This may be because of his OCPD, or simply because of his strong drive to create a perfect world. It is also possible that being a Shinigami, Kid was weaker against the Madness.\n\nAlthough Kid's obsession with symmetry often hinders his performance and focus on missions, he still has good intentions. He wants to follow in his dad's footsteps and help make the world a more peaceful place that is safe from evil."},{"mal_id":1795,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/1795\/Motoko_Kusanagi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/2\/314931.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/2\/314931.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/2\/314931t.webp"}},"name":"Motoko Kusanagi","nicknames":["Major"],"favorites":9915,"about":"Height: 5'6\"\n\nMotoko Kusanagi is the mysterious, even enigmatic woman who has led a group of SpecOps for years, and was recruited by Aramaki to work for Section 9.

Even by his clan's standards, Madara's chakra was especially strong. He grew up constantly competing and training with Izuna and in their efforts to surpass each other, each gained their own Mangeky\u014d Sharingan. With the power of the Mangeky\u014d the two brothers took control of the clan, with Madara as its leader. Under his leadership, the clan conquered all they came across. Because of the never-ending series of battles of the time, Madara eventually began to suffer from overuse of the Mangeky\u014d Sharingan, leaving him blind. In order to regain his sight he took Izuna's eyes for himself, granting him an \"eternal\" Mangeky\u014d Sharingan with which he led the Uchiha clan to prosperity.\n\nOver the years, the Uchiha had constantly fought with the equally powerful Senju clan and as such, Madara had an undying rivalry with Hashirama Senju, the leader of the Senju clan. To bring an end to the constant fighting, Hashirama approached the Uchiha with an offer of peace. Although Madara never wanted peace with the Senju, the rest of the Uchiha wished to end the fighting, and Madara had no choice but to accept. The Senju, the Uchiha, and all the clans they had conquered came together to form the village of Konohagakure.\n\nSome time later, the villagers of Konoha selected Hashirama as the village's first Hokage much to Madara's dismay. Madara feared that Hashirama would oppress the Uchiha, and tried to rally support for challenging his leadership. Rather than help him, the Uchiha turned their backs on him, believing he only desired to rekindle the flames of war.\n\nSoon after being rejected the position of Hokage and being abandoned by his clan, Madara left the village, and sought out Nine-Tails. He later returned in order to challenge Hashirama in battle. They fought at the site that would someday be called the Valley of the End, where Madara was defeated, despite having Nine-Tails at his side. Control of Nine-Tails was ultimately taken from him and Madara died."},{"mal_id":71267,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/71267\/Kenma_Kozume","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/417885.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/417885.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/417885t.webp"}},"name":"Kenma Kozume","nicknames":[],"favorites":9863,"about":"Team: Nekoma High School\nAge: 16\nHeight: 169.2 cm\nWeight: 58.3 kg\nBirthday: October 16\nYear: 2nd Year, class 3\nNumber: 5\nPosition: Setter\nFavorite food: Apple pie\nCurrent Concerns: Summer is hot and winter is cold\nAbility Parameters (out of 5): Power = 1; jump = 2; stamina = 2; intellect = 5; technique = 5; speed = 3\n\nKenma has a very relaxed and laid back personality.

This ability led to his title as \"Konoha's Yellow Flash,\" and it caused him to be seen as so dangerous that a flee-on-sight order was given in regards to him during the Third Ninja War. He also created the Rasengan, a technique that does not rely on hand seals but instead uses a concentration of spinning chakra in one's palm that causes immense damage to its victim on contact.

He had long bright yellow hair with red streaks akin to flames along with two shoulder-length bangs and two chin-length bangs on the side of his head, black forked eyebrows, and golden eyes that fade to red with white pupils.\n\nKyojuro wore a paler brown version of the regular Demon Slayer uniform, which consisted of a brown gakuran jacket, a white belt around his waist and hakama pants. Over this, he wore a haori with a white-yellow gradient pattern and red flame-like ridges at the end that his father Shinjuro once worn and more than likely his father worn when they were the Flame Hashira respectively. Finally, he wore red Kyahan with yellow flames erupting from the bottom-up, with pale brown tabi socks and a pair of white z\u014dri with red straps.\n\nKyojuro was greatly enthusiastic in regard to his duties as a Hashira, and often came across as cheerfully eccentric. He was amiable, pure of heart and boasted extraordinary technique and swordsmanship stemming from strict practice and discipline. He was an honorable warrior who adhered to his code of morals and principles that was instilled into him by his mother at a young age\u2014the most significant being his belief that those who were born strong have a duty to protect the weak.\n\nKyojuro also loved his family immensely, displaying great respect and worry towards his father, Shinjuro Rengoku, despite him growing slowly more aggressive and apathetic towards Kyojuro. He is incredibly encouraging and optimistic towards his little brother, Senjuro Rengoku, believing in him and wishing him the best no matter what. This is further accentuated during his death where his final words for his father and his little brother were \"take care of your body\" and \"follow your dreams no matter what\". Kyojuro also believes that if someone lacks immense skill, their hard work towards their dreams and desire to help people doesn't count for nothing.\n\nBeneath his enthusiastic demeanor, Kyojuro is very logical and tactically intelligent, acting quickly and precisely in battle, especially when the lives of others are on the line. Kyojuro also is great in seeing talent in others, even in Nezuko, a Demon which he wanted to kill beforehand after seeing her risk her lives to fight Demons. Though he is extremely optimistic, Kyojuro does sometimes have a sense of foreboding that those he believes in might die, especially his friends which he care deeply for.

Ace's back tattoo is left intact in the English version of the dub despite 4Kids' previous edits to crosses. At the same time Ace also promotes his tattoo to Luffy, something which is truly considered odd by 4Kids standards. Ace has a tattoo on his back of the Whitebeard symbol; a skull with a white mustache and a manji behind it. To avoid confusion between the two symbols and avoid slander for being a nazi, this was changed to crossbones in the shape of a \"cross\" in the anime, as well as in the most recent chapter of the manga.\n\nAce has another tattoo on his left arm by the shoulder: it reads \"ASCE\" with the \"S\" (apparently a mistake on the part of the tattoo artist, or, alternatively, the symbol that appeared on the flag of his old crew  crossed out.

He also sports rather childish freckles. He is apparently narcoleptic (a trait common amongst Ace's family) and therefore falls asleep on random occasions, making people wonder if he has dropped dead. As far as personality goes, Ace is much more intelligent, polite, and generally more bearable than his younger brother, which prompts the Straw Hat crew to question whether he is truly related to their bumbling captain. However, the brothers themselves are very close, Ace portraying typical good-big-brother behaviors such as asking the crew to keep an eye on his little brother.\n\nIt is revealed that Ace had a bounty of 550,000,000 in the One Piece Ten exhibition.\n\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":2219,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/2219\/Lain_Iwakura","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/78358.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/78358.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/78358t.webp"}},"name":"Lain Iwakura","nicknames":[],"favorites":9081,"about":"Lain, the main character of Serial Experiments Lain, is a 14-year-old girl who uncovers her true nature through the series.

He inherited the Book of Friends from her, a book of contracts binding ayakashi to servitude when they were defeated by Reiko. Due to Natsume's strong resemblance to his grandmother, he is often mistaken for her and is pursued by ayakashi who hate Reiko but yearn for the Book of Friends. To rid himself of these troubles, Natsume resolved to end the book by returning all the contracted names to their former owners. He is accompanied by the youkai Madara, nicknamed \"Nyanko-sensei\" (or simply \"sensei\"), promising him possession of the book once he dies. In return, the creature must serve as his bodyguard until then.\n\nOrphaned at an early age, Natsume was passed on from relative to relative. His ability to see and communicate with ayakashi isolated him from both family and friends throughout his childhood. He was labeled as a \"liar\" and \"attention seeker\" for trying to tell others about the ayakashi, and his attempts to run away from the youkai had them calling him insane. Natsume then became reclusive in order to try to lead a relatively \"normal\" life with people. Eventually, he was passed on to the Fujiwaras, a middle-aged couple from his father's side of the family. In contrast to the relatives before, they genuinely care for Natsume, and he loves them in return. He does not want to cause them any trouble, so the ayakashi problem remains secret.\n\nNatsume's incredibly strong spiritual power allows him to actually hit and hurt youkai. He develops friendships with youkai and exorcists alike, though the interest of many is to use him to their advantage. In the anime, Natsume is more cheery and good-natured, while in the manga, he is slightly more dismal and short-tempered, especially toward Nyanko-sensei.\n \nTo return the names inscribed in the Book of Friends, Natsume must first picture the said ayakashi in his mind to learn of its name. The book then flips open to the page where the name is written, which he takes out and places in his mouth while breathing out. The spell which originally enslaved the spirits used Reiko's saliva and breath; as Reiko's grandson and one who bears a strong resemblance to Reiko, Natsume is able to use the spell as well. The cost of releasing each name, however, is that his energy is almost completely drained in the process."},{"mal_id":507,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/507\/Howl","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/83512.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/83512.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/83512t.webp"}},"name":"Howl","nicknames":["Jenkins","Pendragon"],"favorites":8926,"about":"Wizard Howl is a mysterious, reclusive wizard.

He begins his story as a new freshman in the town of Morioh. Part 4 begins with Joutarou seeking him out, as Jousuke is the illegitimate son of Joutarou's grandfather, Joseph Joestar.\n\nJousuke makes his entrance into the JoJo universe as a caring, popular, and slightly na\u00efve teenager. Inspired by his police officer grandfather's (on his mother's side) sense of justice, he isn't afraid to fight for those in need. He is confronted by Joutarou with the need to eradicate evil Stand users from his hometown, Morioh. He refuses at first, believing that it is not any of his business. However, he quickly changes his mind when his policeman grandfather is killed by a criminal Stand user. With a vow paralleling that of Peter Parker, Jousuke decides to deliver justice to evil Stand users in his grandfather's place.\n\nJousuke is nice to people and says \"Mister\" and \"Miss\" like a normal, polite young man until someone pisses him off (which isn't very hard to do). The easiest way to do that is to mock his hair, which makes Jousuke angry and explosively violent. Jousuke grew up with his single mother, never knowing his father Joseph Joestar. Jousuke is crafty and has a sneaky streak for money, which is shown multiple times in the story. Nevertheless, he is a dependable and friendly person who is always willing to protect people who need it.\n\nJousuke's Stand power, Crazy Diamond, is a melee Stand with short range (2m). Crazy Diamond has the ability of \"restoration.\" It can repair damage (by returning an object to a previous state) and by extension heal injuries (apart from Jousuke's own injuries). It is limited in that it cannot revive the dead. It can, however, restore an item to its raw materials (e.g., a table can be restored to timbers). This ability allows Crazy Diamond to perform a range of interesting feats, including trapping the enemy (by restoring pieces of a broken crate around the target) and tracking (e.g., restoring a torn piece of clothing so that it will seek out what it came from and reattach). Its restoration ability often \"malfunctions\" when Jousuke is angry, causing the object to be improperly put back together. The Stand's name is a reference to Pink Floyd's song, \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond.\""},{"mal_id":164472,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/164472\/Nobara_Kugisaki","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/422313.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/422313.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/422313t.webp"}},"name":"Nobara Kugisaki","nicknames":[],"favorites":8669,"about":"Age: 16\nBirthdate: August 7\nHeight: 160 cm (5'3'')\n\nKugisaki Nobara is a girl born in Morioka, who moved to Tokyo to get away from the countryside.

Ulquiora is the 4th ranked espada.\n\nUlquiorra is also analytical; during his and Yammy's first visit to the human world, he makes several remarks on the humans who confront them. He theorizes that Orihime Inoue's healing power is a temporal-spatial ability, which Aizen describes as the rejection of fate, and comments on how Ichigo Kurosaki's final release can easily get through Yammy's defenses. He also notes Ichigo's power fluctuation, which varies between very weak and stronger than his own.\n\nIt would appear that Ulquiorra and Grimmjow, the 6th Espada, are not on good terms. While Ulquiorra allowed Yammy to kill anyone he deemed as \"trash,\" which included Ichigo, Ulquiorra allowed him to live based on his belief that Ichigo's power was so turbulent that eventually he would destroy himself. Grimmjow's conflicting viewpoint was that Ichigo should have been destroyed outright, as he could overcome his weakness and grow even stronger. Despite Grimmjow's argument, Aizen trusted Ulquiorra's judgment. This disagreement led to Grimmjow's unauthorized assault on the real world. Though Ulquiorra is of a higher rank than Grimmjow, Grimmjow is confident that Ulquiorra is afraid to fight him for fear of them destroying one another.\n\nWhen released his zanpakutou, Murci\u00e9lago (Japanese for \"giant black-winged demon,\" Spanish for \"bat\"), creates two large black wings on his back. His hollow helmet centers atop his head, sporting two large horns, and his arrancar uniform appears more form fitting at the top, becoming robe-like towards the bottom. Additionally, Ulquiorra is apparently unique among the Espada in that he has a second release; Resurrecci\u00f3n Segunda Etapa (Spanish for \"resurrection second stage\"). He becomes more muscular with clawed hands and feet, the whites of his eyes turn black, and his helmet is replaced with elongated horns. He loses his clothes; his arms and legs from the hip down are covered in black fur, and he gains a long thin tail. In both forms he can create long \"lances\" of energy called Lanza del Rel\u00e1mpago ,ransa deru reranp\u0101go?, Japanese and Spanish for \"lance of the lightning\"), and when thrown can cause an explosion. Ulquiorra seems unfamiliar with the technique when he uses it in his second release state, unexpectedly missing Ichigo with his first one, however, to compensate, he can produce more should his first miss the target.\n\nTheme song: \"Moonshield,\" on the album \"The Jester Race\" by the group \"In Flames.\"\n\n(Source: Bleach character books I-III)"},{"mal_id":3180,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/3180\/Pain","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/73473.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/73473.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/73473t.webp"}},"name":"Pain","nicknames":["Nagato","God","Child of the Prophecy","Saviour of this World","Third Six Paths"],"favorites":8030,"about":"Pain is the recognized leader of Akatsuki, partnered to Konan, with Tobi acting as his benefactor.

Even after the Amanto take-over of Japan, Katsura continues to resist the Amanto, and has amassed a band of followers. His weapon of choice is a metallic grenade. He is a wanted man due to his involvement in terrorist activities against the Bakufu, and is constantly on the run from the Shinsengumi. Although his initial methods were originally more violent in nature (for instance, sending a bomb to an Amanto embassy), Katsura has gradually grown to believe that there are people important to him in Edo, and decides that he no longer wants to destroy the country, but believes there should be a way to change it without causing sacrifices.\n\nKatsura seems to be highly respected by his followers, and has even been called the \"Daybreak of the Joui Faction\" by some. When people believed that Katsura had died during the Benizakura arc, even other terrorist groups tried to avenge his death.\nSince he is a wanted man, Katsura is often seen wearing disguises, although his identity is often still easily found out. One example of a disguise he seems to be fond of is a pirate's costume, complete with an eyepatch (with a skull design) over his left eye and a scar on his right cheek, and using this he calls himself 'Space Captain Katsura.'\n\nKatsura seems to possess a rather outdated sense of humour, and sometimes refers to things from a past era, such as when he tried to buy a Famicon when people were queuing up to buy the OwEe (a parody of the Wii). He also seems to have a tendency to make up dramatic stories, which moves others to tears when they hear these stories (except Gintoki).\nKatsura sometimes works odd jobs (e.g. in Episode 88), to raise money for his terrorist activities. He claims that his heart has started to be moved by Ikumatsu in episode 39 (chapter 55 equivalent of the manga), and held his subsequent interview in her ramen restaurant.\n\nIn the Japanese version, Gintoki often calls him \"Zura.\" In the first English volume, Gintoki calls him \"Casserole,\" or \"Cough syrup.\" Eventually, the English version changed to Gintoki calling Katsura \"Zura.\" In the Japanese version, Katsura indignantly replies \"Not 'Zura'! It's Katsura!\" (and will do so anytime he is called something other than his name). In the English version he replies \"Not Casserole! It's Katsura!\" The Japanese version joke is a pun, since \"Katsura\" can mean wig in Japanese and \"Zura\" is slang for the same thing. The English version is also a wordplay since \"Katsura\" and \"Casserole\" sound somewhat similar in pronunciation. He has the uncanny ability to know when someone has called him something other than Katsura, even in their head. An example being in Episode 25 as a guest to Gintoki's hotpot dinner.\n\nHis name is based on the historical Katsura Kogoro."},{"mal_id":16021,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/16021\/Rider","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/142869.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/142869.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/142869t.webp"}},"name":"Rider","nicknames":["Alexander the Great","Iskandar","King of Conquerors"],"favorites":7828,"about":"Height: 212 cm \nWeight: 130 kg\nTrue Identity: Alexander the Great\/Iskandar, King of Conquerors \nMaster: Waver Velvet\nCatalyst: Mantle once worn by Iskandar himself\nHoly Grail War No.: 4th Holy Grail War\n\nRider was originally meant to be summoned by Lord Kayneth El-Melloi Archibald, but due to some circumstances, he ended up being Waver Velvet's servant. \n\nIskandar, or how he refers to himself, the King of Conquerors is a noble and courageous man, who prefers to conquer his enemies by winning without killing and controlling without humiliating them.

Often seen with a cigarette and in a revealing outfit complete with bright yellow hot pants and a matching, revealing top, black suspenders, white boots, and a long-sleeved red shirt worn normally through the sleeves, not to mention her signature headband, she is unusually attractive, sporting a bob of violet hair, green eyes, fair skin, and a voluptuous body. Although appearing to be no more than her 23 years alive suggests, Faye is actually upwards of 74-years-old, having been put into cryogenic freeze after a space shuttle accident. During the course of the series (set in 2071), Faye manages to cross paths with Spike and Jet twice before she finally makes herself at home aboard their ship the second time, much to the consternation and disapproval of the two men, both of whom have their own reservations about women in general. Faye herself is brash, egotistical, and quite lazy, despite taking plenty of time to pamper and care for her own appearance. Faye has also been placed under arrest several times in the series and spends much time in handcuffs on the ship. She, at times, expects the boys to take care of bounties for her, while she sits by idly to reap the benefits and eat all their food, another source of conflict.\n\nSeemingly little more than a thorn in her partners\u2019 sides, Faye is actually a well-rounded member of the team. She can handle herself exceptionally well for a woman of her slight appearance, displaying at least once in the series (in \"Cowboy Funk\") that she packs quite a mean punch. Adept at flying, Faye has stood her ground just as well as Spike has in an aerial dogfight in her ship Red Tail, at times even against Spike in an aerial dogfight. She also excels with guns, and is first seen in the series completely disabling a ship with a Heckler &amp; Koch MP5, though she is immediately apprehended afterward. In the movie, she is seen with the same gun, in addition to her normal companion: a Glock 30. Where Faye really shines, however, is with her mouth. She has an almost unstoppable attitude, and even her sometimes innocent smile can be seen as dangerous. Sarcastic and presumptuous, she rarely appears weak or in need of support.

At an early age, he acquired an obsessive interest in video games; now he is known as \"The Capturing God (\u843d\u3068\u3057\u795e, Otoshi-gami?)\" in the gaming world for his legendary skills in \"capturing\" any girls in dating sims. But ironically, he is called otamegane (a derogatory portmanteau of the two words otaku and megane-\"glasses\") by almost everyone in his school due to his extreme devotion to videogames. Despite himself saying he likes girls, it's the perfectly theoretical and beautiful girls of the game world that he prefers, not the girls in reality. His love for games is such that he even goes into withdrawal if he doesn't play games enough and he has the bad habit of locking himself in his room and playing games for days on end when he's depressed.\n\nAt the start of the series, Keima becomes a collaborator for catching runaway spirits when he replies to an instigative e-mail to his mail address in his PFP (otoshi-god@zumcities.co.jp) requesting his help to \"capture\" girls without knowing it was a contract from Hell, to which Elsee appeared and asked for his aid to \"capture\" girls in real-life. For each individual of the \"Capture Targets\"\u2014a girl with the runaway spirit in her\u2014Keima utilizes his analytical skills and experiences from dating sims to \"capture\" them. When he has figured out the final push needed to \"capture\" a girl (in both reality and games), he says the catchphrase \"I can already see the ending.\" Whenever he isn't capturing runaway spirits, he is almost always seen playing video games on his PFP (a parody of Sony's PSP), which might explain his weak physique.\n\nAlso, despite the fact he even plays video games in class, he is still at the top of class in every subject. During a scolding of a teacher for his gaming habits, Keima reasoned that all would be fine as long as he aced all his exams; he then proceeded to do so, demonstrating a great academic ability. It is shown that Keima's analytical skills he utilises to \"capture\" girls is also applied by him in his studies, proven true when he flawlessly predicted the questions on the upcoming English test based on the teacher's personality and the examination extent. As the story progresses, his perspective of the \"real world\" girls becomes different. Nevertheless, he remains faithful to his \"2D girls,\" in particular, a girl named \"Yokkyun\" who seems to be drawn in a parody style of famed visual novel Kanon.\n\nHis mastery and devotion to girl games was revealed to be way higher above than just average otakus. He is able to play six games at the same time with each of different screens with the activation of his 'Capturing God Mode.' His PFP breaks numerous times during the series, but later found that he actually has a lot of spare PFP hidden around his body. He frequently does lengthy lecture on various archetypes of characters and philosophies on capturing girls. However, he is completely ignorant to everything else, including real girls and their body, foods and even his own life.\n\n\n\nHe likes to present things in numerical manners; such as saying that he has seen certain type of girl 300 times in games.\n\nHis first name is derived from the term \"gamer.\""},{"mal_id":4839,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/4839\/Gray_Fullbuster","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/278602.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/278602.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/11\/278602t.webp"}},"name":"Gray Fullbuster","nicknames":[],"favorites":7385,"about":"Age: 18\nHair color: black\nEye color: dark blue\nOccupation: Mage\nAffiliation: Fairy Tail Guild\nTeam: Team Natsu\nMagic: Ice-Make, Ice Magic\n\nGray Fullbuster is a member of the Fairy Tail guild.

Despite this superficial attitude, Lucy is passionate for literature and is in the process of writing her own novel about her adventures with Fairy Tail.

Natsu and Gray seem a little scared of her when she's under the weather, even if Lucy's magic is not as strong as theirs and can't force them into submission like Erza.\n\nLucy practices Stellar Spirit magic, a skill which allows her to summon spirits from another world using Keys of the Gates. Her Stellar Spirits have varying levels of power, with different ones suited for different tasks. For example, Aquarius can control water, while Taurus has enormous strength. Along with her keys, she also carries a whip, which she is proficient with. Lucy explains to Natsu that Stellar Spirit mages have the potential to obtain extremely rare Gold Keys, which open the gates of the \"Ecliptic Zodiac\", and common, store-bought Silver keys. Each gold key has the Zodiac symbol of the one it is used to summon on it. According to Lucy, while there is a large number of silver keys, there are only 12 gold keys. Thus far in the series, Lucy has obtained 10 Gold Keys and 4 Silver Keys. She also summoned all of her Gold keys (5 of them at the time) and Plue at once, although it only lasted a few seconds, it showed her to be very powerful.

She also has dark brown pupils and a fair complexion. Because of the effects of being a Flame Haze, Shana's body age remains to that of a girl of 11 to 12 years old. Upon invoking her powers as a Flame Haze, her hair and eyes change color to a fiery crimson, with embers fluttering from her head down.\n\nIn her first few years as a Flame Haze, she wears an all-black attire consisting of a shirt, pants and her Treasure Tool Yogasa in the form of a trench coat. However, after she decided to stay in Misaki City, she is most usually seen with the Misaki City Municipal High School uniform and when in combat, has the Yogasa as a cape worn over her clothes.\n\nShe is later seen wearing a red-and-black frilly dress on her stay inside the Seireiden. \n\nInitially, she is concentrated solely on her duty as a Flame Haze, not even considering getting a name as she didn't see any importance having it. She sees Yuuji only as a Torch, an object, albeit marginally interesting because of his status as a Mystes. However, she slowly opens up to Yuuji, coming to think of him as a person despite being a Torch, and eventually comes to show affection to him. Her duty made her indifferent towards human life at first, but through Yuuji's influence, Shana has opened up slightly, although she still remains confused and disgruntled by some human traits which she considers as pointless, although some of it is used to mask her jealousy of her desired monopoly on Yuuji.\n\nShana has a habit of saying \"Urusai! Urusai! Urusai!\" (\"Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!\") whenever Yuuji asks her questions or makes remarks that disturb her original worldview or embarrass her. But in reality they really care for each other. She has a great fondness for anything sweet, eventually putting melon bread above her preference.\n\nShana is shown to be highly intelligent as she has gotten a perfect score on every exam and is talented in Physical Education. She is shown, however, to be naive when it comes to social affairs, once even unabashfully asking \"how babies are made\" to Chigusa. \n\nKnown only as the \"Flaming-Haired, Blazing-Eyed Hunter,\" Shana bears no name until she meets Yuuji, who names her after the sword she wields. As a \"Flame Haze,\" Shana is sworn to protect the balance of the world by hunting down the \"Guze no Tomogara;\" monsters from the \"Crimson Realm\" who come to earth in order to harvest the \"Power of Existence\" from its denizens. Together with Alastor, \"Flame of the Heavens\" and Shana's guide who lives within her, and speaks to her through a necklace she wears, she has become one of the most powerful Flame Haze in existence.\n\nShana is said to be the most powerful, known and feared by most Crimson Denizens with her title alone. This has allowed her to defeat many powerful Denizens, and permits her many different abilities, including her proficiency with the Nietono no Shana, the ability to wield flames, manipulate the Power of Existence, harbor extrasensory traits, and fly with wings of flame. In the third volume of the manga, the first volume of the novel, and the movie, Alastor states that the reason why she did not explode after being shot by Friagne's Trigger Happy was because she held a capacity that existed in dimensional space, who was able to contain the Flame of Heaven's (and more); He has thus stated her as \"The Great One\".\n\n\n\nHowever, she demonstrates a clear lack of experience in battle, as noted by Sophie Sawallisch, who has witnessed her fighting style first-hand.This is once responsible for her defeat against Flame Haze Margery Daw, who is a specialist in Power of Unrestraint. \n\n\n\nDespite being the title character of the anime, Shana has few character relations with many of the characters in the show. That would be because of the manner she was raised. Wilhelmina, Shiro and Alastor mostly focused on her physical and mental being, forgetting that being as socially adept is as important. This was, as Alastor said, one of their mistakes, since they thought that they would just teach her these feelings when she grows up a little more, not realizing that these feelings should be developed, and could not be taught so hastily. (Although, Shiro did teach her indirectly that love is the most powerful unrestricted spell of all.)\n\nHer main social interest is Yuuji, whom she sees as her love interest. Her relationship with Yuuji is one of the driving forces of the series. Shana takes orders and advice from the Crimson Lord she is bound to, Alastor, and has a mentor and guardian in the form of Wilhelmina Carmel. Kazumi Yoshida is her love-rival for Yuuji, and Shana treats her with contempt and disdain. She generally treats most other characters with ignorance and indifference, with the exception of Chigusa Sakai, who she looks to as a source in answering certain difficulties when Alastor or Wilhelmina are unable to do so. Shana eventually starts to be more open to the other characters, especially in regards to her relationship with Kazumi becoming more friendly. \n\n After meeting Yuuji, Shana goes through a chaotic phase in she experiences new emotions like love, jealousy, hatred, and loneliness. This leads her to making rash decisions in battle as she's unable to identify or deal with what she's feeling. When Shana finally realizes that having Yuuji with her in battle helps her fight better, she begins to unlock new abilities and becomes more proficient in battle."},{"mal_id":87287,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/87287\/Mikaela_Hyakuya","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/282380.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/282380.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/282380t.webp"}},"name":"Mikaela Hyakuya","nicknames":["Mika","Mikaela Shindou"],"favorites":6988,"about":"Age: 16-17\nBirthday: May 1\nHeight: 173 cm (5'8\")\nWeight: 57 kg (126 lb)\nBlood type: O\n\nMikaela is kind and upbeat in spite of the harsh events in his childhood, when he was abused by his parents and then dropped out of a car.

Hisana abandoned Rukia when she was still a baby since she could not continue to support both herself and Rukia. Rukia grew up on her own until she met Renji Abarai and other children her age. They worked together to steal food in order to survive and became a makeshift family. She's a bit of a tomboy to show that she's tough. During this time, Rukia and Renji showed signs of having spiritual power. While they initially opted against becoming shinigami, the death of all their friends prompted Rukia to suggest joining the academy for a better life.\n\nAt the shinigami academy, Renji was admitted into the top class and Rukia into the second ranked one. Renji and Rukia started growing further apart as Renji got further ahead in his training. The emotional distance continued until Rukia was asked to join the Kuchiki family. Renji expressed happiness for Rukia's opportunity but both did not admit that they disagreed with the arrangement since they would likely never see each other again. Rukia reluctantly joined the family and was immediately inducted into the 13th Division without having to graduate or take a squad entrance exam. Unknown to Rukia, Byakuya had adopted her in order to fulfill the last wish of Hisana, whom he had taken as his wife.\n\nIn the 13th Division, Rukia was not given a seat position, due to Byakuya Kuchiki's influence, since he did not want her sent on dangerous missions. She became friends with the division lieutenant, Kaien Shiba, who trained and mentored her. Their first training location was Mount Koifushi of Hokutan, the 3rd district of West Rukongai.\n\nRukia greatly admired Kaien's wife, 3rd Seat Miyako Shiba. When Miyako was killed by a hollow, Rukia, Kaien, and the division's captain, J\u016bshir\u014d Ukitake hunted the hollow down. Kaien faced the hollow alone but the hollow's special ability destroyed his zanpakut\u014d. Rukia attempted to draw her sword and help but was stopped by Ukitake. He told her that Kaien's fight was one of honor rather than a fight for his life. If Rukia helped, Kaien would be saved but his honor would be damaged forever. Meanwhile, the hollow entered Kaien and possessed him. Ukitake faced the hollow but his illness allowed the hollow the opportunity to attack Rukia. Kaien momentarily regained control and thrust himself through Rukia's zanpakut\u014d. He thanked Rukia and Ukitake for letting him fight for his honor and died in Rukia's arms. Rukia brought the corpse to the Shiba family but was afraid to apologize since she felt guilty about her role in Kaien's death.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":43814,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/43814\/Yona","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/14\/292691.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/14\/292691.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/14\/292691t.webp"}},"name":"Yona","nicknames":[],"favorites":6824,"about":"Age: 16\nBirthday: April 7\nSign: Aries\nHeight: 157 cm\nRace: human\n\nAs the princess and the only heir of the Kouka Kingdom, Yona was raised with extreme care and gets whatever she wants, for example, beautiful accessories and clothing.

He's short tempered, impulsive, and likes to intimidate those who are afraid of him. One of his most notable traits is his desire to fight, which becomes more noticeable as the series progresses. Yuusuke has been noted on many occasions to being rather unintelligent and, at times, just plain stupid. Yuusuke's desire to fight is more out of enjoyment of a good brawl, and surprisingly Yuusuke doesn't like killing if he can avoid it.\n\nEven though Yuusuke is feared by most students; and severely disliked by almost all of the teachers, he is generally misunderstood. Keiko Yukimura is one of the very few who knows Yuusuke is actually very kind, and she sympathizes with his problems in life. Yuusuke and Keiko quickly develop strong feelings for each other; and he is fiercely protective of her, almost always worrying about her well-being. Yuusuke initially didn't like Kuwabara, but as the series progresses, the two develop a mutual bond and respect for each other, with Kuwabara being the only person who truly understands him. Yuusuke and Hiei have a serious rivalry and, at times, Yuusuke seems almost intimidated by Hiei's remarkable skills. Yet, each of them has respect for the other, and will put their lives on the line to help one another. Yuusuke is very close to Kurama and has a great amount of confidence in him. Yuusuke respects Kurama's wisdom, sometimes looking to him for leadership advice when he's not sure what to do."},{"mal_id":5578,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/5578\/Kaiji_Itou","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/29010.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/29010.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/29010t.webp"}},"name":"Kaiji Itou","nicknames":[],"favorites":6515,"about":"The main character of the story.

She plays a Fender Mustang MG69\/MH\/CAR electric guitar which she eventually names Muttan, but is also in possession of a Gibson Les Paul Custom 50th Anniversary Gold Top (as seen in episode 13). She is a self-proclaimed novice guitarist who has been playing the guitar since the fourth grade and whose parents play in a jazz band. She is in the same year and class as Yui's sister, Ui, and has quite a mysterious demeanor. She often finds herself bewildered by the tea parties and cosplaying aspects of the club when she would rather just practice, and is struck by how good the club's music sounds despite their problems and lack of practice. However, she has a certain weakness for cakes and can be calmed down rather easily, sometimes by just being petted. She is more serious than the other girls, and does not like to admit how she really feels; she could be described in part as a tsundere. She is constantly hugged by Yui and is nicknamed Azu-nyan after trying on a pair of cat ears and meowing.\n\nIn the band, she looks up to Mio the most due to her maturity and the fact that she is an experienced musician, even trying to give Mio chocolate on Valentine's Day. However, she sometimes unintentionally makes remarks concerning Mio's weaknesses, such as her weight. She also finds Mugi very beautiful, and envies her hair and large eyes, and later starts teaching her how to play guitar when the two are alone in the club room. Since joining, Yui comes to her for advice on playing guitar, as well as maintenance. She gets a tan extremely easily, once during their time at the beach and another during a music festival (even after applying sunscreen). As a result, she frequently gets sunburned as well. She gets lonely very easily, and often worries that everyone in the club will leave her, as they are one-year-older and eventually will graduate. Due to this, the rest of the girls buy her a turtle to look after, naming it Ton-chan.\n\nShe is interested in a wide range of genres without limiting herself to anything in particular. She started playing instruments in fourth grade of elementary school, which makes it about 5 years of experience. Her parents both play in a jazz band.\n\nOutside of the band, she often hangs out with Ui and Jun whenever the other girls are busy. When the others graduate, she becomes the new Light Music Club president alongside Ui and Jun, who decide to join her. Together with two new members, Sumire and Nao, they form a new band called Wakaba Girls. During the Wakaba Girls' first summer training camp Azusa reveals to Sawako her belief that she is unable to act like a proper president for the Light Music Club; however, Sawako suggests that there is no proper way to define what it means to be a president and that Azusa will do just fine. While on that same training camp Azusa is convinced by the others to become the band's vocalist despite her prior reservations on the issue, and eventually overcomes her weakness to sing in the school festival.\n\nHer preference in clothing includes pants over skirts. Short pants are among the things she likes to wear. Her room is very tidy and not excessively cute.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia, K-On!

She has golden irises and vertically split pupils; on her left and right temples are two thick horns protruding crookedly, and on her waist is a pair of black angel wings.\n\nAlbedo wears a pure white dress with silky gloves covering her slender hands, and a golden spiderweb necklace that covers her shoulders and chest.

He is already well-known as a brilliant young detective, the \"Savior of the police force,\" for solving many difficult cases that the professionals could not. However, while investigating two mysterious men, he is spotted and forced to swallow an experimental poison known as APTX 4869. This results in his body shrinking to that of a 6-year-old.\n\nShinichi comes up with the alias Conan Edogawa after Arthur Conan Doyle and Edogawa Rampo and pretends to be a distant relative of Agasa's who places Conan in Ran's care. Ran's father Mouri Kogorou, owns a Detective Agency which Conan uses to his advantage to discover cases involving the Black Organization.\n\nAs Conan, Shinichi helps Ran's father solve cases by putting him to sleep and simulating Kogorou's voice using the special bowtie gadget Professor Agasa made for him. By solving cases one after the other, he helps build up Kogorou's reputation who will later on be referred to as \"Sleeping Kogorou.\" He also spends a good amount of time with his Detective Boys fellows and solves many small cases with them and sometimes in the company of Professor Agasa.\n\nConan remains very close to Ran, who in return is very protective of him. However, because Ran is unaware of his true identity, Conan often finds himself in awkward situations with her, such as when she confessed her feeling for Shinichi to him and when she made him bathe with her at a hot spring.\n\nConan's intelligence remains intact even though he has shrunken into a child. As Shinichi, his deductive ability earned him the monikers \"Heisei Holmes\" and \"Savior of the Japanese police force.\" Conan maintains an extraordinarily broad knowledge of many subjects and trivia that help him solve cases and escape tricky situations. Conan tries to speak in a child-like manner when dealing with adults, but he often gets caught up in the current case and begins speaking like an adult, referring to advanced topics and using reasoning much too complex for a normal child. When this happens, he often tries to pass it off as \"something [he] heard on TV\" or \"taught by uncle Kogoro\/professor Agasa\/Shinichi-niichan.\"\n\n\nLikewise, he makes no effort to hide his love for Sherlock Holmes and soccer, so if he called out for talking about either subject in too much detail, he tries to escape suspicion by saying it was something Shinichi told him about. Although as the series has progressed the adults around him have become more used to his \"being quite smart for a child,\" causing him to behave more like himself around them, he still tries to pass as a normal child. The only police officers with whom Conan can speak in a professional manner are the FBI, especially Jodie Starling, Shuichi Akai, James Black, and Inspector Kansuke Yamato of the Nagano Police, all of whom suspect that there is more to Conan than meets the eye.\n\nConan tends to act more like himself around the Detective Boys, even to the point that they find it odd when he acts like a child around adults. He will often play games like baseball with the Detective Boys, but he is too used to soccer to perform well and will even instinctively use soccer techniques, such as kicking in games that do not call for it. Because he is unfamiliar with popular games and TV shows, and bad at video games, Genta and the others tend to think of him as dumb. This annoys Conan so much that he will secretly watch TV in the living room after Kogoro and Ran go to sleep to get more \"practice\" in.\n\n(Source: Detectiveconanworld.com)"},{"mal_id":18,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/18\/Haruhi_Fujioka","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/55779.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/55779.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/55779t.webp"}},"name":"Haruhi Fujioka","nicknames":["Haru-chan"],"favorites":6345,"about":"Birthday: February 4\nAge: 16\nZodiac sign: Aquarius\nHeight: 155 cm (5'1\")\nBlood type: O\nFavorite subjects: Classic Japanese, English, World History, Host club learning time\nFavorite foods: Ootoro (fancy tuna), seafood, strawberries, candy apples, high class food\nHost type: \"Natural\"\nMid-term Exam Ranking: 1st year, 1st place\nSentai color: Red\nRanking in dai hin min: 6th\nRose color: Red\n\nHaruhi Fujioka, the main heroine of the story, is an intelligent freshman attending the prestigious and expensive Ouran High School.

Unlike Inuyasha, Sesshoumaru is a full-blooded dog-demon and is contemptuous of InuYasha for being a half-demon and for consorting with humans. He is a very powerful demon who seems to have no true equal when it comes to raw power; although given the chance in volume twenty-three, he could not defeat Naraku. Although fandom refers to him as the Lord of the Western Lands, this title appears at no point in the manga. Takahashi also stated that Sesshoumaru has no permanent home. Unlike almost every other demon in the world of InuYasha, he has no interest in possessing even one shard of the Shikon Jewel.\n\nSesshoumaru first appears in search of the sword called Tessaiga, created from their father Inu-no-Taisho's fang, which has the power to kill a hundred y\u014dkai with one swing; however, Inu-no-Taisho left Tessaiga to Inuyasha, and Sesshoumaru instead inherited the Tenseiga, a sword which cannot harm the living, but can bring the dead back to life. Inu-no-Taisho did this in the hopes that Sesshoumaru would learn compassion. Considering Tenseiga useless to him, Sesshoumaru battles Inuyasha several times for possession of Tessaiga, and when Tessaiga is broken by a bite from Naraku's incarnation Goshinki, Sesshoumaru has Goshinki's fangs forged into the evil blade Tokijin, which only he is powerful enough to control. Initially, Sesshoumaru is ruthless and cruel in his pursuit of Tessaiga and his dealings with his brother.\n\nDespite having a hatred for humans, he seems to care for Rin, a little human girl who was orphaned after her village was destroyed by demons. Rin found Sesshomaru in the woods by the village she lived in, and noticed that he was injured (due to a previous fight with Inuyasha) and she tried to help him. Sesshomaru refused her help, but after finding her body nearly devoured by Koga's wolves later on, he used Tenseiga to bring her back to life. Now Rin follows Sesshomaru around and thinks of herself as one of his servants."},{"mal_id":68583,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/68583\/Akane_Tsunemori","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/179601.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/179601.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/179601t.webp"}},"name":"Akane Tsunemori","nicknames":[],"favorites":6112,"about":"Age: 20\nBirthday: April 1, 2092\n\nThe main female protagonist and the newly assigned Inspector of Unit 1.

Picked up keyboard upon joining the Light Music Club.\nFamily structure: Family of three, both parents. Father is a president of a company. There is a butler at the house. She is being treasured as the only daughter.\nDwelling: Single-family home, a rather stately mansion.\nCommute to school: By train (she lives two train stops away from the school). Because being driven to and from school by car is embarrassing for her, she avoids it.\nPreferences in clothing: Skirts over pants. High society lady styles, such as elegant one piece dresses.\nHer room: Canopy bed, antique furniture and such, as expected of a rich girl's room. The room is decorated mostly according to her parents' tastes.\nFavorite food: She prefers traditional sweets such as daifuku (rice cakes with red bean jam filling) because she worries about calories and because western sweets are brought to her house all the time and she is tired of them.\nSubjects she is good at: If anything, humanities, though she is also above average at science and math. While she is a little weaker than Mio when it comes to math, her math skills are certainly above her grade level.\nSubjects she is bad at: No subject in particular.\nPhysical activity: Tsumugi is gentle and quiet and as result she is not good at ball games and track-and-field athletics. However, she has a lot of arm strength and amazing hand grip. She is a very strong girl.\nWay to pass the time when alone: Elegant teatime\nWeaknesses and dislikes: She is a little worried about her predisposition to gain weight easily.\n\n    Tsumugi, often referred to as 'Mugi' by her friends, is a wealthy girl with a gentle and sweet personality who plays a Korg Triton Extreme 76-key keyboard, though she is also seen playing a Korg RK-100 keytar in the closing credits of the first season. She originally intended to join the choir club, but joins the light music club instead after receiving an invitation and encouragement from both Mio and Ritsu.Tsumugi is considered a piano prodigy since she has been playing the piano since she was four and has experience in winning various piano contests. Mugi has long, pale blonde hair, blue eyes, unusually large eyebrows, which apparently run in her family and a fair complexion that the other characters do not have, but she does not get sunburned. She is the daughter of a company president, and her family has several villas in various places around Japan (and even one in Finland). Since her father also owns a maid caf\u00e9, she often brings confectionery and an assortment of sweets and pastries to the club room, and she diligently makes tea with a tea set which is kept in their club room. Despite her wealth, she is fascinated by and finds joy in \"normal\" activities, such as ordering fast food, sharing french fries with her club mates, holding down part-time jobs and haggling over prices. Tsumugi displays a rebellious streak occasionally, diverting from her normally well-behaved and mature demeanor to the surprise of the others. She also displays a childlike eagerness from time to time, and possesses unusually high strength, being able to effortlessly carry around her own keyboard, Ritsu's drums, amplifiers, and at one point beating an arm-wrestling game in an arcade.\n\n    Tsumugi is often entranced by the sight of two girls interacting closely together, sometimes imagining something more risqu\u00e9 in her head. The series sometimes indicates that Mugi has a crush on their teacher, Sawako Yamanaka. While a lot of things do not bother her, she is fairly conscious about her weight (just like Mio), and she gets a bit anxious when her family's staff start spoiling her friends during villa visits. She later begins learning how to play the guitar from Azusa. Tsumugi has a childhood friend several years younger than her named Sumire Sait\u014d who is a daughter of the family that serves the Kotobuki household. Tsumugi grew up home schooled, and therefore spent very little time in the outside world. Because of their close friendship Sumire would purchase everyday items like manga for Tsumugi that she was not normally allowed to see. Tsumugi was rather taken by some of the yuri manga she received which may have influenced her later perceptions about relationships. When Sumire started high school, Tsumugi wanted her to experience the light music club on her own, but due to Sumire's shyness Tsumugi came up with the excuse to send her to the club room to pick up the tea sets that had been left there and told Sawako when Sumire did join that it was okay to leave the tea sets there.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":81853,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/81853\/Decim","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/273283.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/273283.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/273283t.webp"}},"name":"Decim","nicknames":[],"favorites":6033,"about":"Affiliation: Quindecim\n\nDecim is the bartender of Quindecim and an acting arbiter for the dead.

He is a loud arrogant boaster who tends to refer to himself as Ore-sama (a Japanese name suffix intended for people of great importance) and he rarely ever shows a shred of consideration towards other fighters after a loss.\n\nTakamura was discovered on the streets by Coach Kamogawa Genji, and his speed, power, and technique are all high-level to the point that he is capable of handling both In Fighters and Out Boxers without too much trouble. Unlike most characters in Hajime no Ippo, he has no special finishing blow, but every punch he has possesses killer destructive power. With the wild power to always force out any situation he claims will happen, he is a man who does everything he says he will.\n\nAs the one who got Ippo, Aoki and Kimura into boxing, he is well respected at the Kamogawa Gym. Even though he constantly looks down on and ridicules their achievements, his unrivalled strength and the few moments his true kindness leaks out prevent them from losing their respect for him. Takamura loves to pick on his fellow gym mates, with Aoki usually the first on his list. Although he tends to get more serious when hearing about or training for his next match, he still finds the time to play pranks on everyone and goof around.\n\nHe is the current WBC and WBA World Middleweight Champion and former WBC Junior Middleweight Champion. He was also the JBC Middleweight Champion, but relinquished it after 4 title defenses. He lives alone at the Ohta Inn apartment complex, and his room is littered with junk, old food, pornography, and even his Belts. He still lives there even after becoming World Champion, preferring a simple life.\n\n\nThe character for Taka (\u9df9) in his name means hawk, and as a result he is sometimes nicknamed The Japanese Hawk by announcers and spectators (most notably during his matches against Brian Hawk and David Eagle).

At the beginning of the series, Sakuragi was a slacker, always trying to ask girls out but getting constantly rejected (the 50th rejection occurring at the start of the series). He then met Akagi Haruko, with whom he fell in love immediately. This passion led to him joining the Shohoku basketball team. However, as a complete beginner, he was not able to keep up with the rest of the team at first despite his physical attributes (great height, athleticism, stamina, speed and leaping ability). He regards himself as a genius though, with self-confidence that borders on arrogance. His most recognizable trait is his red hair, though he shaves his head as reparation for an error that led to the loss against Kainan.\n\nAt first, Sakuragi was known for his poor basketball skills as a beginner; in his first few official matches, he fouled out every game. However, his basketball skills advanced throughout the series. First he developed his basic skills, such as dribbling and layups. Then, trained by Akagi, he became a formidable rebounder; his rebounding became his claim to fame throughout the latter half of the series. He also is seen more than once defining the match for Shohoku in the last seconds, for instance, by dunking a ball that Akagi would have missed in the league round match with Ryonan. His jump shooting was then developed by Coach Anzai, who had him make 20,000 shots in a week. He hit a buzzer-beating jump shot to win the match against Sannoh. However, he also injured his back during the match against Sannoh, and underwent rehabilitation after Shohoku's subsequent loss to Aiwa Academy.\n\nIn spite of the setbacks he has had to face, Sakuragi displays a great deal of tenacity and determination that carry him through and help reciprocate for his other failings, both on and off the court. Although his love for Haruko and rivalry with Rukawa are the main driving forces motivating him to succeed in basketball, his injury during the Sannoh match makes him realize that he has actually come to love the game, leading him to give his all for his team and bring them victory. \n\n(Source: Hoopedia)"},{"mal_id":496,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/496\/Shirou_Emiya","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/173271.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/173271.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/173271t.webp"}},"name":"Shirou Emiya","nicknames":[],"favorites":5762,"about":"Age: 17\nAffiliation: Homurahara Academy, Year 2 class C\nHeight: 167 cm\nWeight: 58 kg\nServant: Saber\nLikes: housework\nDislikes: Umekobucha \nTalents: tinkering with junk, housework\nFamous quote: \"I don't want to regret anything.

The scarf is made from silver-white windflower light silk (ginpaku kazahana no uzuginu) and is a family heirloom handed down through the generations to the head of the Kuchiki family.\n\nLittle is known about Byakuya's early history, except that he often played tag with Yoruichi Shihouin using flash steps, though he never was able to beat her, a score that upholds to the current time of the series.\n\nByakuya married Hisana, who was then a commoner; therefore, he broke the rules by accepting her into the noble Kuchiki family.\nShortly before her death, Hisana asked Byakuya to find and adopt her biological sister, Rukia, whom she had abandoned as a baby. She also made him promise that he would not tell Rukia about her real family, for she believed that by abandoning Rukia when she was younger she was not worthy to be called her sister.\nOne year later, Rukia entered the shinigami academy; shortly after, Byakuya found her and immediately adopted her into the Kuchiki clan. By adopting her Byakuya respected his wife's last wish, but had broken the rules of his clan again.\nHe later swore upon his parents' graves that he would never break the rules again, no matter what. As a result, he, though entirely apathetic on the surface, is actually deeply conflicted with the matter of Rukia's execution: should he intervene, it would require breaking the promise to his parents and the rules again, but should he do nothing he would fail to fulfill the promise he made to Hisana to protect Rukia as his own sister.\n\nWhile it is not clear, it is implied that Byakuya Kuchiki became captain of the 6th division less than 50 years before the main Bleach storyline (shortly before Rukia had entered the Gotei 13). Gin Ichimaru became captain of the 3rd Division at the same time.\n\nByakuya Kuchiki's zanpakut\u014d is Senbonzakura (\u5343\u672c\u685c, A Thousand Cherry Blossoms). Its shikai is triggered by the command \"scatter\" (\u6563\u308c, chire).\nIn its shikai, Senbonzakura's blade scatters into a thousand tiny blades. While the blades are supposedly too small to see normally, they appear as cherry blossoms because of the way the light shines on them. Byakuya can control the blades at will, allowing him to shred opponents at a distance and break through almost any defense. While Byakuya can control the blades with his mind alone, using his hands allows him to do so more effectively, making the blades move almost twice as fast.\n\nByakuya's bankai, named Senbonzakura Kageyoshi (Vibrant Display of the Thousand Cherry Blossoms), is essentially a much larger version of Senbonzakura's shikai. To activate it, Byakuya drops his sword. The sword passes through the ground and two rows of giant blades rise up from the ground behind Byakuya. These then scatter into a million tiny blades. The number of blades is great enough that Byakuya can use them for defense as well as offense.\n\nByakuya's bankai has two extra forms, achieved by arranging the blades in different patterns. They are activated by saying the name of the technique followed by the name of his bankai. The first is \"scene of a massacre\" (senkei, Viz: \"annihilate\"), which unites the scattered petals into complete swords that form four rows around Byakuya and his opponent. While Byakuya can control these swords as he does his regular blades, he usually attacks with just one in hand. After immobilizing an opponent, he can call in the other blades to hit them while they're trapped. He can also use all the blades at once for one immensely powerful strike. The second form is \"final scene\" (sh\u016bkei, Viz: \"last sight\"), which condenses every tiny blade into a single sword to drastically increase its cutting power. The blade appears bright white, earning it the name \"white imperial sword\" (\u767d\u5e1d\u5263, hakuteiken, Viz: \"white emperor sword\"). Byakuya also grows pure white wings and a halo-like circle in the back, both made of spiritual power. In the anime, dragon-like beings sprout out of Senbonzakura to create the wings. It is unknown whether these wings are merely a cosmetic effect or if they can be used to fly.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":123699,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/123699\/Takagi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/348969.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/348969.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/348969t.webp"}},"name":" Takagi","nicknames":[],"favorites":5513,"about":"A middleschooler at an unnamed school, she sits at the back of class 1-2 next to Nishikata.

His background and experience as a guerrilla fighter, and later a mercenary soldier has made him much more sensitive and knowledgeable about tactics and methods more commonly used by guerrillas than government trained regulars. \n\nSousuke is unfortunately not very good at social interaction off the battlefield. He constantly causes many problems for Kaname Chidori due to his military nature. Even in school he carries a gun with him although it is loaded with non-lethal shells. He is also very bad at blending in with normal members of society due to his nature (i.e. following Kaname with stalker-like aspects and jumping off a train to follow her). That is, he has no readily available \"civil\" concepts about life, like entertainment or anything recreational and tends to horribly misinterpret the actions of people around him(like considering a guy who dumped his girlfriend a high-level tactician who is to be reckoned with). This is shown throughout the main series in multiple episodes, and the Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu! series focuses mainly on this aspect. This part of his personality is indeed one of the main sources of the series' humor. \n\nHis previous name during his guerrilla days was Kashim which was given to him by Majido, a strategist of the guerrilla forces in Helmajistan. \n\nIt is assumed that he changed his name to Sagara Sousuke when he left Helmajistan. While in Helmajistan he had a close friend named Zayid. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":8631,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/8631\/Shiro","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/114507.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/114507.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/16\/114507t.webp"}},"name":"Shiro","nicknames":[],"favorites":5267,"about":"A mysterious albino girl that Ganta encountered during his first days as an inmate.

Having a fearsome reputation for her \"God's Tongue\" to taste the food flavor accurate, Erina is able to disqualify anyone whose the dish taste \"bad\" and her foul critic could break the chef (and student alike) soul of tenacity. She is also one of the Elite 10 in Tootsuki Culinary Academy and uses her position to judge a student dish based on their family background and status.\n\nBorn in the prestige and influential family with affluent finances and refined pedigree, Erina is one of the arrogant, prideful and pampered students in Tootsuki Culinary Academy. Typical wealthy family's princess from her high famed family background, she looks down on people (particularly Souma) or society which doesn't share her lifestyle and only socialize with the group of people which have an abundance wealth and strong influences. Having a reputation known as \"God's Tongue\" for an ability to taste the food accurately and excel cooking skills, Erina is very serious upon the regal cooking style and classy ingredients, in which can't be tolerated if any failures or distaste within' the food, even the slightest could make a very big deal about it. According to the living legend, \"Doujima Gin,\" her tongue was so special that she can taste 8 different salts blindfolded. Due to her reputation, she is both inspired and feared by many newcomers within the academy (except Souma), even the academy lecturers and her \"senpai\" found her narcissistic ego was so overwhelming that she is too stubborn to listens to almost anyone. Other than that, Erina is also picky about food to which she rather picks high-class cuisine instead of daily dishes, and claimed that normal food doesn't match her taste. Erina is also sadistic to which she often relish on people suffering and reluctance over her offer as her amusement, while she is also narcissistic that only she is better than anyone in the academy (except Souma who found that she is actually dishonest to herself and even claimed her dish boring due to her ego.).\n\nDespite all of her narcissistic, arrogant and stubborn mannerism, Erina is also shown\u00a0to be a \"tsundere\" student who denied almost everything even after all there are something good about it, particularly Souma which his food tasted so good that even her god tongue couldn't help but be impressed over his style. Likewise, despite her attempts to remain aloof and regal in her interactions with Souma, she is shown to\u00a0be easily flustered by Souma's casual and laid back attitude\u00a0due to\u00a0her overrated ego and\u00a0often ends up in comical embarrassment whenever Souma ignores her insults. Some situation said that Erina's imagination played an important yet ridiculous role which depends on her mood, any odd imagination she had would affect the student's result, usually the bad way. Erina also not a student who, because of her ego, admit her mistakes and her narcissistic behavior almost made her blinded and even phobia on mistakes (she may enjoy a sadistic pleasure to make her rival suffers, yet she is displeased whoever \"mock\" her or her weakness is found by certain figures). Even there is a slightest critique about her food (Souma is, in fact, the only student fearlessly point her weakness) would make her throw her tantrums, and often taking drastic measures just to cover her weakness.\n\nDespite rarely participate in any Shokugeki, Erina's cooking style is believed to be the finest and elegant of all. Using all of every stylish style from the wealthy and high pedigree status of culinary, she referred the lavish ingredient to make the finest dish of all and suggested that only the high grade dish considered as eatable for her standards. It is also noted by Doujima himself that her cooking skills cannot be underestimated due to her quick skills along with her nickname \"God's Tongue,\" by managing to create the dish that matched her taste before completing the dish. It is also claimed that she can cook as fast as Souma, which made her one of the proficient rivals to Souma's style even though she rarely cooks (she is prideful of her skills though)."},{"mal_id":1080,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/1080\/Grimmjow_Jaegerjaquez","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/159977.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/159977.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/159977t.webp"}},"name":"Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez","nicknames":[],"favorites":5204,"about":"Race: Arrancar\nGender: male\nHeight: 186 cm\nWeight: 80 kg\nAffiliation: The Espada\nRank: #6\n\nDate of birth: July 31st\nZodiac sign: Leo\nHole location: Abdomen (\u8179\u90e8)\n\nGrimmjow has light blue hair, and his eyes have blue\/green lines below them that are similar to the red marks on Ikkaku Madarame's eyes. Grimmjow's attire consists of a white hakama and a black sash, his white jacket is ragged and consists of an upturned collar, with black inner lining, the sleeves are rolled and Grimmjow wears it open; chest revealed. The remains of his jawbone like hollow mask are relegated to his right cheek, and his hollow hole has moved to his abdomen.\n\nGrimmjow appears to be a laid back and irreverent individual, but this scruffy appearance hides an impulsive, excessively violent personality and a lethally short temper. Grimmjow is blunt, rude, and quite sadistic, revealing an insane grin in battle, much like Kenpachi Zaraki. Grimmjow has little respect for authority and says whatever is on his mind, regardless of whether or not it is appropriate. This attitude leads to conflicts with Kaname T\u014dsen, who holds Grimmjow in the same low regard as he did Zaraki. He also has conflicts with Ulquiorra Schiffer, the 4th Espada, usually because Ulquiorra interrupts his fights or doesn't act on his own impulses. He has also developed a grudge against Ichigo Kurosaki for wounding him during their second fight, and is eager to return the favor. He purposefully kept the large scar on his chest from their first battle as a reminder of this.\n\nGrimmjow is the sixth Espada in S\u014dsuke Aizen's army of arrancar, meaning he is ranked sixth in terms of strength. Grimmjow was the first character to be revealed as an Espada in the series. A crooked number 6 is tattooed on his back just above and to the right of his hollow hole. Aizen personally marks the Espada, the ten most powerful of his arrancar, with such tattoos as visible marks of their rank and ability. After Kaname T\u014dsen cuts off and burns his arm, Grimmjow is demoted and quickly replaced by Luppi, much to his annoyance. After Orihime Inoue heals his arm, he kills Luppi to regain his rank, impaling him on his newly restored arm and then vaporizing Luppi's torso with a cero blast.\n\nWhen his zanpakut\u014d, Pantera (\u8c79\u738b\uff08\u30d1\u30f3\u30c6\u30e9, Spanish for \"panther,\" Japanese for \"panther king\") is released he regains some of his former feline characteristics such as jagged teeth, feline ears, clawed hands and feet, and a tail that can be used as a powerful whip.This state augments his speed drastically and gives him animal-like agility and movements to match. His roar can create shockwaves in the air, he can also fire a number of largely destructive \"darts\" from his elbows and create energy claws called Desgarr\u00f3n (\u8c79\u738b\u306e\u722a\uff08\u30c7\u30b9\u30ac\u30ed\u30f3, Spanish for \"laceration,\" Japanese for \"panther king's claw\") from his fingertips.\n\nGrimmjow's character design draws heavily from a character in Tite Kubo's earlier manga, Zombie Powder. The main character of the series, Gamma Akutabi, shares both the bone-like jaw structure and lost arm with Grimmjow, although Gamma wears mechanical prosthetics to cover his disfigurements. Grimmjow's released form makes the resemblance even more apparent.

(776 U.C.)\n\nCount Reinhard von Lohengramm is a young admiral in the Galactic Empire.\n\nHe was born Reinhard von M\u00fcsel to an impoverished aristocratic family. His mother died when he was very young and he only has faint memories of her. His father's will was shattered at about the same time and the only person left to care for young Reinhard was his beloved older sister Annerose. When Reinhard was about ten years old, his family had to move into a middle class suburban neighborhood. There he met Siegfried Kircheis who would become his best and perhaps only friend, but whatever happiness Reinhard managed to find as a child was to be short-lived. \n\nThe emperor Friedrich IV took a liking to his sister and ordered her to move into his palace and become his new concubine. Afraid that if she refused she would bring down the emperor's wrath on her younger brother, Annerose reluctantly accepted and her father even managed to get some money out of it. Infuriated Reinhard swore vengeance against the emperor, vengeance against the Goldenbaum dynasty and vengeance against the oppressive nobility. He swore that he would never rest until he freed his sister of her predicament and became powerful enough never to be ordered by anyone again. \n\nTo achieve his goals and with Kircheis by his side, Reinhard joined the military. He quickly rose through the ranks and after proving his ability time and again to the hostile and corrupt nobility, ever reluctant to accept a fallen aristocrat like him into their ranks, he became an imperial high admiral and was elevated to peerage as the \"count of Lohengramm\". As he steps into the admiralty, the Emperor gives him the prototype battleship Br\u00fcnhild, which serves as Reinhards flagship from then on.\n\nNicknamed \"Blonde Brat\" by his enemies and \"Golden Lion\" by his friends, Reinhard is a handsome and gifted individual, a superb tactician and an unequaled strategist. Brave and noble, he always leads his fleets from the front, much to the admiration, as well as the horror, of his subordinates. Ambitious and determined, Reinhard is only hindered by his immeasurable pride, his warlike nature and the turmoil in his heart."},{"mal_id":119209,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/119209\/Tsuyu_Asui","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/299409.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/299409.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/299409t.webp"}},"name":"Tsuyu Asui","nicknames":["Froppy"],"favorites":4767,"about":"Age: 15\nBirthday: February 12\nHeight: 150 cm (4'11\")\nAffiliation: U.A.\nQuirk: Frog\n\nA girl in class 1-A.

To help him, he developed an incredible memory: he is able to memorize every single aspect of something he saw, but he commented (in chapter 101) that he could identify \"the key\" (the key which Tyki Mikk gave) faster if he were to use both his eyes when sieving out the real \"key\" from the fake. He is 18 years old, and normally uses his left eye while the right eye is covered by an eye-patch. His anti-Akuma weapon is a size-shifting hammer, which he calls Oozuchi Kozuchi (\u5927\u69cc\u5c0f\u69cc, lit. \"big hammer small hammer\") or Nyoibo. It can grow (\u6e80, man) or extend (\u4f38, shin). The weight increases with its size, but since Lavi is the conformer, the weight does not effect him; However, it does to everyone else. His hammer can also summon several \"judgments\" with kanji possibly representing the classical elements that can be used individually or combined. However, between some of the seals are question marks. This probably means that Lavi has some seals that he has yet to learn from his Innocence. His techniques so far, are:\n- Hi Ban: Gouka Kaijin (\u52ab\u706b\u7070\u71fc \u706b\u5224, lit. Fire Seal: Conflagration of Ash): using the fire seal to create a torrent of flames with the form of a snake;\n- Ten Ban: Raitei Kaiten (\u96f7\u9706\u56de\u5929 \u5929\u5224, lit. Heaven Seal: Thundering Lightning Whirling in the Skies): using the heaven seal to liberate an immense lightning;\n- Moku Ban: Tenchi Bankai (\u5929\u5730\u76e4\u56de \u6728\u5224, lit. Wood Seal: Roots Entwining Heaven and Earth): using the wood seal to control objects in nature;\n- Konbo Ban: Gouraiten (\u30b3\u30f3\u30dc\u5224 \u525b\u96f7\u5929, lit. Combo Seal: Strong Thunder of the Heavens): using both fire and heaven seals to create a huge snake of fire and iron. Also making a shield-like flame wall.\n\nIt was shown when Bookman told Lavi to use the wood seal to clear the clouds (Three Akuma were hiding behind the clouds). Lavi stated that he forgot he could use it to affect nature directly, and as he remembered it the question mark turned into a kanji that he used right away. If seen more carefully the kanji for the wood seal can be seen throughout the manga whenever Lavi summons his seals long before the use of the actual seal itself (e.g. during the use of the heaven seal). At the moment just before its first use the seal can be seen just behind Lavi's head and had never transformed from a question mark in the first place.\n\nThe marks of water and earth also appear among his seals. He likes to call Bookman \"Panda\" due to the thick black circles around his eyes; a converted Akuma \"Chomesuke\"; and Arystar Krory\"Kuro-chan\" in the anime and \"Kro-chan\" in the manga. He is the only character other than General Tiedoll to call Kanda by his given name (that name being Yuu, also translated as Y\u016b or Yuu), and apparently speaks to him outside of missions, a fact that was shown when he called Allen \"beansprout\" (moyashi), saying that if Kanda could call him that, Lavi could as well, as he is the same age as Kanda. He has a habit of teasing Allen, and deems himself as his big brother. A recurring gag in the series is Lavi's fondness for beautiful older women, whenever he sees a woman his type (Example: Eliade) he'll yell out \"Strike!\" with hearts in his eye.\n\n\nThere are many different translations of his name, such as Ravi, Rabi, Labi. But it is found in the D.gray-man Omake from episode 61 that the correct spelling is Lavi.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":503,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/503\/Illyasviel_von_Einzbern","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/368428.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/368428.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/368428t.webp"}},"name":"Illyasviel von Einzbern","nicknames":["Illya"],"favorites":4274,"about":"Age: 18\nBirthday: November 20\nHeight: 133 cm\nWeight: 34 kg\nBWH: 61-47-62\nServant: Berserker\nAffiliation: Einzbern\nClassification: Homunculus\nLikes: snow\nDislikes: cats\nFamous quote: \"I don't intend to kill you, Shirou.

She is the first Spirit saved by Shidou and transfers into his class at the end of the first volume. Shidou named her for the date of their first meeting, the 10th. Reine later added the Yatogami surname for her. She is ignorant of the ways of the world, but nevertheless has a normal sense of embarrassment. She seems to have strong feelings for Shidou, which she is shown to be unable to understand when she gets jealous after seeing Shidou accidentally kiss Yoshino.\n\nWhen Tooka first appeared on Earth, unsealed, she was very wary of everyone before Shido finally got the chance to talk to her, because she was constantly being attacked by the AST. However after she was sealed by Shido, she could finally develop, express, and experience life on Earth. Due to the fact that Tooka is new to everything including her emotions, she has a very child-like personality that can make her seem na\u00efve, emotional, energetic, and sometimes gullible due to the fact that she has not been on Earth that long to interact with other people.\n\nHowever, when learning that Yoshino is a Spirit like herself she decides to support Shidou in his cause to save the other Spirits such as Kurumi, even actively participating in battles at times. Due to being a Spirit, she is always being targeted by the AST and is aiming for the kill, because of that she hated humans for always shunning her and thinking that she wasn't allowed to live in this world, but her whole life changed when she met Shidou.\n\nShe was overjoyed that she could live with Shidou now but knowing that Origami was there too she was somehow agitated and is always having a minor quarrel with Origami (mostly because of Shidou and their feelings). Even with that high and cool presence, Tooka lacks some common sense and loves food very much. Despite her lack of knowledge or experience, Tooka does have a normal sense of embarrassment, as shown by her overreacting when seen naked, or caught in otherwise embarrassing situations. At times, Tooka can be surprisingly insightful, as well as perceptive and understanding in regards to other people's feelings, especially when it concerns Shido and her fellow Spirits. She gets also along very well with Kaguya and Yuzuru, especially Kaguya because of their similar energetic personalities. However, Tooka sometimes has problems understanding the two of them, because of the weird way each of them talks.\n\nTooka is a highly offensive combatant who uses a sword as her primary weapon. Aside from this, Tooka also has a lot of \"mana\" within her spirit body which increases both her offensive and defensive abilities. Her primary armament is Sandalphon, which takes on the appearance of a gilded throne which doubles as the scabbard of her broadsword. Her fighting style mostly consists of either physical attacks with \"mana\" encasement on her sword and body, or a high energy attack (like a laser beam) combined with her sword.\n\nThe throne itself seems to be a sort of support machine, based on how she uses it. It can be changed into a transport vessel by laying it horizontally, or to unlock the final form of her weapon, Halvanhelev, by cutting the throne into exact halves. Later in the series, after she got her power sealed by Shido, she can retrieve a bit of her original power if she focuses hard enough or if she becomes emotional."},{"mal_id":2819,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/2819\/Takumi_Fujiwara","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/14\/296425.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/14\/296425.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/14\/296425t.webp"}},"name":"Takumi Fujiwara","nicknames":["Tak"],"favorites":4160,"about":"Age: 18, 19 (Project D)\nCar: High tech two-tone Toyota Sprinter Trueno GT-APEX (AE86)\nLikes: green seasons, rear end of his AE86, naps\nDislikes: showoffs, losing, girls that flirt\n\nTakumi Fujiwara is the son of Bunta Fujiwara, the owner of a tofu shop in his hometown Akina. He rarely shows emotion. His best friend is Itsuki Takeuchi, who is a racing fan.\n\nTakumi works part-time at a gas station with Itsuki, along with Iketani, who is a member of the local racing team, the Akina Speed Stars. In the first few episodes both Itsuki and Iketani think that Takumi has no driving ability because of Takumi's total disinterest in cars and racing.\n\nThe only one who suspects that Takumi has an advanced driving technique is the owner of the gas station, Yuuichi, as seen in the episode where Takumi discusses drifting technique with Iketani and Itsuki. In fact, Takumi has far more experience on the touge than Iketani and Itsuki, as Takumi has been driving his father's AE86 Trueno for five years (since he was 13 in his first year of junior high school, 7th grade), delivering tofu to a hotel at 4 a.m. every day. Takumi has been manipulated subtly by Bunta into developing driving skills, without being fully aware of Bunta's intent.\n\nBunta aside, Takumi's driving technique is the best on Akina; the very fact that he has managed to win races against far more powerful cars with his AE86 Trueno is testament to his driving skills. As a result of constant everyday practice and over 5 years of experience on Akina, Takumi is able to adapt to nearly any situation that presents itself during a race with astonishing speed. One factor in his nearly unparalleled driving skills is his ability to visualize the road in his head, thus making up for the lack of visibility no matter how dark the mountain pass may be. He is an instinctive rather than an intellectual driver. Although the mizutoshi technique is a great but difficult technique that his father taught him, it lead him to many victories through out the story.\n\n\nTakumi looks docile and weak minded, but he is stubborn and strong-willed, many remarks are said about that. Yuuichi figure out he was like his father in his behavior. However, to those who have raced against him, Takumi possesses tremendous concentration and instinctive insight once behind the wheel (and these qualities are most evident when he is chasing after his opponent). His apparent docility became traps for many opponents.\n\n\n\nIn [i]MF Ghost[\/], he travelled to England at the age of 20, participated in rally races in the country, and shown his prowess when racing in paved surface. He won his first championship in his third year of racing and was nicknamed \"Flying Japanese\" . He would then sign a contract with Toyota to compete in WRC, but during a test the car's driveshaft broke and the car then fell into a valley, which made him suffer serious injury and ended his career as a professional racer.\n\nHe then become an instructor in RDRS driving school and would become Kanata's instructor. His method of teaching is by giving his students vague tasks and let his students give an answer after doing such tasks.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":90177,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/90177\/Utaha_Kasumigaoka","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/325309.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/325309.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/325309t.webp"}},"name":"Utaha Kasumigaoka","nicknames":["Utako Kasumi","Shi-chan"],"favorites":4122,"about":"Birthday: January 31\nThree sizes: B89-W61-H88\n\nPopular acclaimed writer whom Tomoya Aki is a fan of.

He has a cunning, goal-oriented mind and does not seem to care what means he uses to accomplish those goals. His sense of morals is lax at best, but he is quick to find the moral flaws of others, which he keeps recorded in his \"Book of Threats\" or \"Devil's Handbook,\" and uses this information to blackmail everyone from students to figures of authority into placing him in a position of power. He has little respect for authority and has in fact usurped authority over Deimon High School well before the series begins and know authority of a vice principal, using his power in the school to give himself beyond-perfect scores in all his classes and divert funds to the American football club as he desires. Besides blackmail, Hiruma can often intimidate others into taking the action he wants by waving around his vast arsenal of firearms. Even without having to take direct action, Hiruma's mere reputation is enough in some instances to make the majority of the student body fear him and bow to his authority. \n\nDespite his penchant for blackmail and breaking seemingly every school rule without consequence, Hiruma adheres to the rules of American football without exception while playing. Inagaki says that Hiruma \"does everything else to win\" and is \"only concerned with winning.\" Instead, Hiruma attempts to throw opposing teams off guard through taunts and insults. Even when Hiruma expresses excitement or happiness, he does so in a violent manner, by firing his large guns into the air or kicking a teammate in the rear when they have executed well on a play. \n\nHe addresses all members of the Deimon Devil Bats with a vulgar manner, beginning with \"Fucking\" and ending with a descriptive noun, such as \"Shorty\" for Sena or \"Monkey\" for Monta. Some characters, such as Kid, have observed that Hiruma's attitude and even aspects of his demonic appearance are an act to intimidate his opponents both on and off the field. Over time, the series has alluded to Hiruma's 'true' personality, which Sena and Mamori Anezaki have at times been shown to understand to some degree, as when one or the other correctly observes Hiruma to be worried, happy, or tired. In addition to these instances, Hiruma has shown compassion to others, though he continues to hide it with his demonic behavior \u2014allowing Takami some privacy after a loss is one such instance. In addition, some of Hiruma's actions imply that he cares for the other members of the team more than he lets on. \n\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":506,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/506\/Kirei_Kotomine","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/3\/258487.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/3\/258487.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/3\/258487t.webp"}},"name":"Kirei Kotomine","nicknames":[],"favorites":4032,"about":"Born: December 28, 1967\nHeight: 185 cm (Fate\/Zero), 193 cm (Fate\/stay night)\nWeight: 82 kg\nBlood type: B\nLikes: misfortune\nDislikes: trust\nFamous quote: \"People cannot change the past.

Her outfit consists of a white wide-necked sweater with blue sleeves over a black tank top, a short plaid yellow skirt which is part of the Yokai Academy's girls' uniform, pink and violet stockings (her right stocking slightly longer than her left), and a belt that is wrapped around her left thigh. \n\nMizore returns to school after a delayed absence and was first portrayed as a lonely, somewhat depressed, and misunderstood girl. She becomes infatuated with Tsukune, going so far as to create her own journal\/scrapbook with all of his newspaper articles. \n\nIn the past, she confessed her love to a teacher until he began taking advantage of her, freezing him as a result. With the incident and rumors spreading about her, Mizore made it hard for herself to trust anyone, but took a liking to Tsukune, believing he was just as miserable as she was. She eventually regains her sense of trust after Tsukune intervenes when the same teacher returns to kill her. Unfortunately, this leads Mizore to stalk Tsukune on a daily basis (from around 340 spying locations, according to her). She initially sports long hair in her debut appearances, but cuts it short after the incident was cleared. Later in the second serialization, Mizore decides that even if Tsukune doesn't fall in love with her, she will follow him forever.\n\nA running gag in the series is that Mizore always appears unexpectedly in the oddest locations (under tables, behind doors, the ceiling, bushes, and even in the bathroom), and freezes any girl to disrupt any sort of tender moment Tsukune is having with the latter. \n\nKeeping in line with her kind, Mizore has the ability to control snow and ice at will, and while doing so, shapes claws of ice around her hands (her hair becomes ice on rare occasions). She can also make almost perfect copies (if a bit fragile) of herself and others with it as well, each capable of independent thought.

In many instances, Kurama has shown to be very self-sacrificing in the interests of the safety of his friends and family.\n\nYouko Kurama was a cold hearted and ruthless thief and the most feared bandit in Makai. He was considered to be an A-class demon (though he eventually surpasses that), and is said to be more than a thousand years old.\n\nAfter being wounded by a bounty hunter while in his spirit fox form, Kurama sent his spirit into the Ningenkai (human world) where his spirit took refuge within an unborn child that had not yet gained a soul. It was from this point that Kurama made the transfer to a human body with the intention to recover his strength as the child developed. Kurama planned to leave Ningenkai to return to Makai after regaining his strength after an estimated ten years. However, sometime during or before the tenth year, an act of selflessness by his mother, Minamino Shiori, opened Kurama's eyes to pain he had caused his mother while growing up. Thus, he decides to continue living his human life as Shiori's son.\n\nKurama's special ability is that he can turn plants into deadly weapons by manipulating his youki into that plant. Kurama has complete control over any Human Realm plant and has some control over Demon Realm plants. However Demon Fox Kurama has complete control over Demon Realm Plants and has more power than regular Kurama. The strength of Kurama's moves depends on how much aura Kurama uses. He has an incredible sense of smell and he can read lips. Though Kurama is considered the second weakest of the four main fighters, topping out at low S-class power by the end of the series, he is easily the smartest fighter of the four.

Neji and Lee have somewhat of a rivalry, much like that of Guy and Kakashi Hatake. Lee is determined to prove that a \"failure\" such as himself can defeat a \"genius\" such as Neji. Neji, however, doesn't seem to be interested in this goal of Lee's, and Lee doesn't seem to have made an effort to prove the point to Neji. Despite this apparent clashing of ideals between the two, Neji seems to get along fairly well with Tenten, with the latter often helping Neji with his training. Neji and Tenten also tend to share opinions on Lee and Guy's overreactive behaviors, often wondering how they can train the way they do.\n\nAs a member of the Hyuga clan, Neji has a Byakugan, allowing him to see the chakra flow of others and block the flow upon contact with his Gentle Fist style. As a member of the clan's branch house, Neji can never hope to be taught how to use the clan's most secret techniques by the clan's elders. Despite this, Neji has learned many of the clan's strongest techniques independently, even creating a few unique skills of his own. Because of this, Neji is known as a genius ninja and graduated from the Academy as the #1 rookie.\n\nBecause his father, Hizashi Hyuga, was a member of a branch house of the Hyuga clan, Neji was born into the branch house. As a result, he was branded with the Hyuga branch family seal at a young age so that the members of the main house could keep him in check. Hizashi, believing Neji to be denied his potential as a branch house member, openly resented the main house, causing Neji to acquire the same feelings due to his father's influence. In time, Neji's hatred for the main house would increase exponentially as result of Hizashi being sacrificed to save the life of Hiashi Hyuga, Hizashi's twin brother. Neji believed that his father was forced to die for his twin brother. Because of this, Neji came to feel that fate was something decided at birth and that no matter what one does, people cannot escape their destiny. This idea would go on to shape Neji's life, creating a deep hatred for the main house and all of its members. \n\nAfter the Chunnin Exams when Neji fights Naruto his both his great skill and potential are recognized by the clan leader, his uncle Hiashi Hyuuga, and is sought out by him to train with the main branch of the family to further enhance Neji's skills.

Before joining Akatsuki, Deidara was as a terrorist bomber for hire, where his work attracted the attention of Pain. Pain sent other Akatsuki members to recruit Deidara, though he refused. After being defeated by Itachi Uchiha, however, Deidara was forced to join the organization. Deidara maintained a deep loathing for Itachi from that point further and became determined to defeat him, even training one of his eyes to overcome Itachi's signature ability: genjutsu. Deidara was partnered with Sasori upon joining the organization, whose artistic ability and insight Deidara admired. After Sasori's death Deidara is paired with Tobi whom he treats as a disciple. Despite Tobi's habit of accidentally angering Deidara, Deidara takes great care to keep Tobi out of harm's way and even dedicates his final moments to apologizing to him.\n\nIn battle, Deidara uses special mouths in the palm of each hand to create Exploding Clay, chakra-infused clay that explodes on command. He commonly uses the command \"Katsu\" to trigger it. The blast strength of his creations is determined by how much chakra he adds to them. His clay can take on any size or form, ranging from microscopic in size to copies of himself as tall as a skyscraper. Deidara refers to his creations as art, believing the most beautiful thing about them to be their detonation. His admiration for his art is such that he believes it can't be defeated, leading to overconfidence in battle. Depending on the complexity or potency of one of his works, Deidara applies it a designation from anywhere between \"C1\" to \"C4\", the former being the most basic and the latter being his strongest and most complex attack.

Much like L, Near shows various odd behaviors during his normal life. He is usually seen hunched over rather than sitting. He also constantly plays with various toys, which he uses in his theories, as well as idly twiddling strands of his hair. He shows a great respect for L, basing much of how he solves crime on L's methods, even to the point where he only takes cases that he is interested with rather than trying to pursue justice.

He will occasionally swear in the situations he's in, and will not hesitate even if it is towards Rachel, despite her young age. It is also revealed that Zack never had any education of sort, as hinted in his inability to read, and when characters in the story explain things to him in long terms that makes Zack frustrated and unable to understand unless if it was explained to him in simplest terms. Because of his lack of knowledge and education, when he is put into a situation which requires using the brain to figure something out, he often forces upon Rachel to do the problem solving.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nZack has a mental disability, whether it was something he had since he was born or he developed at some point in life is uncertain. This disability consists of him having a lust to destroying things, even to the means of killing. His blood rushes to a certain point and causes him to lose control of his urges. He will go into a short phase of destroying anything in his way until he's satisfied or until he rehabilitates.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nHowever, it can be regarded that while Zack is not academically intelligent, he is high in instinctive\/survival intelligence, where he relies on his instincts to get him through situations, and can be seen as clever. Which could be how he was able to survive as a child, and up until now. And perhaps can even be described as an animal in a way. Zack is also extremely strong and rather fast, being able to run at rather incredible speed rates, and overall is actually a rather powerful character, which balances out the fact he isn't that smart. Zack is also VERY brutally honest, as he hates people who lie with a burning passion, and never ever sugarcoats anything he says.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nAs a child, Zack was seemingly much more quiet and reserved. He was shown to never say a word throughout the manga specifically.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nZack's first murder: He stayed in a run-down orphanage where children were likely to die, and the trafficking was illegal. His caretakers were rather abusive, and always referred to him as a monster, and even forced him to bury the corpse of a dead child simply because they didn't want to deal with the smell. Until one day, one of the caretakers left the TV on, where it showed a horror film that included a serial killer. And Zack just-so-happened to stumble upon it while it was on, becoming fascinated with the murderer specifically in the film. And he took inspiration from it, and he murdered his caretakers by mutilating their bodies, and later buried them in the back. And years later, his recent killings became famous, and is currently a wanted criminal.\\n\r\n\\n\r\n(Source: Satsuriku no Tenshi Wiki)\\n\\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\\n\\n"},{"mal_id":1789,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/1789\/Ai_Enma","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/250047.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/250047.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/250047t.webp"}},"name":"Ai Enma","nicknames":["Jigoku Shoujo","Hell Girl","Ojou"],"favorites":3320,"about":"The primary protagonist of the series.

Noda is, at the start of the series, a twenty-year-old free-spirited second-year music student. She is depicted as a complete slob: her cooking and cleaning skills are atrocious to the point of having mushrooms growing on her clothes and poisoning anyone who dares to eat her food (yet she's never been poisoned). However she is an incredibly talented pianist who primarily plays by ear, in a cantabile style. In love with Chiaki, she follows him around constantly, claiming to be his \"wife,\" and leans on him to help her get through sticky situations. She sometimes compulsively needs to play the piano, neglecting everything in order to do it. As well as that, she seems to enjoy childish manga and movies. She is constantly hungry, and is fed dinners by Chiaki; she also steals many lunches from her fellow friend, Maki. Nodame has a tendency to speak cryptically (sometimes she doesn't even understand herself), often refers to herself in the third person and uses nonsense words like mukya and gyabo.\n\nNodame is initially very dependent on Chiaki in terms of ambition - she has little intention of becoming a professional pianist, despite her remarkable talent, and wants to become a kindergarten teacher, though many feel she is too reckless and lacks the appropriate sensibility to be responsible with teaching children. Her piano style is considered to be completely haphazard, diverting from original intent at both dynamics, rhythms and even themes. Realizing that her current attitude towards music will eventually drive her apart from Chiaki, Nodame gradually develops the necessary drive to pursue music for her own sake. Her attitude towards music is largely due to an incident in the past where she was hurt by a teacher who demanded her to play music \"as it's written.\"\n\nNodame's character is based on a real-life counterpart with same name."},{"mal_id":41311,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/41311\/Gin","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/2\/160251.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/2\/160251.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/2\/160251t.webp"}},"name":"Gin","nicknames":[],"favorites":3065,"about":"Gin is a spirit of the forest.

She is a truant high school student with pyromaniacal tendencies; she also smokes a lot and spends most of her time under a bridge. She is often seen with a camera, and was once seen smoking worn cigarette with \"Never Knows Best\" written onto the paper.\n\nShe has the peculiar tendency to name people and things \"Ta-kun (Or sometimes simply spelled as Takkun),\" after her personal nickname for Naota's brother (and Naota himself). The \"-kun\" suffix is an informal and intimate honorific primarily used when addressing males of equal or junior status. Mamimi is likely using Naota as a substitute for Tasuku and therefore refers to him as \"Ta-kun\" which can be short for both Naota and Tasuku. (Naota is well-aware of the similarity between his nickname and his brother's name.) Mamimi also calls Tasuku \"Tasuku-sempai\" since he is an older classmate.\n\nThe story originally sets forth that her fascination with fire stems from Tasuku having rescued her from the elementary school fire, although it is later hinted that she was the one who started that fire. Mamimi holds an almost quixotically weak grip on the difference between fantasy and reality; for example, she believes Canti to be the manifestation of Cantido, the video game god to whom she burns things as sacrifices. She also emanates an aura of benign vapidness that causes much of the cast (Naota's classmates especially) to look upon her with disdain and her peers to bully her. In fact, Mamimi can be exceedingly destructive\u2014although only when nobody is watching. She spends much of FLCLimax exacting retribution against those who have wronged her\u2014only to have her plan backfire.\n\nMamimi can be seen to lack control over her life or willpower, hence the near-constant smoking and child-like reliance on others, whether it'd be Naota or his older brother Tasuku. This could also explain why she loves taking care of things that are weak-willed, which she leaves (or which escape, like Ta-kun, the black kitten) when they start to show independence. This leads to her eventual disinterest in Naota and ultimately proves a disaster for her when her last adoptee, the terminal core from a robot, goes haywire and overpowers first her and then the military.\n\nAs far as high schoolers go, she seems to be rather sexually frustrated, as she often pursues an uncomfortable level of intimacy with Naota (most likely because she sees him as his brother's replacement), which annoys Naota greatly. When he asks why she constantly clings to him, she responds \"If I don't, I'll overflow.\"\n\nMost characters refer to Mamimi simply as Mamimi, but Naota's friends refer to her as \"Naota's Wife\" and Haruko calls her \"Sameji,\" a shortening of her last name. Amarao refers to her as \"that high school girl.\""},{"mal_id":914,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/914\/Piccolo","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/45628.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/45628.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/45628t.webp"}},"name":"Piccolo","nicknames":["Ma Junior","King Piccolo Jr.","Kamiccolo"],"favorites":3025,"about":"Race: Namekian\nHeight: 7' 4''\nWeight: 255 lbs\nBirth Year: 753 Age\nFavorite Food: Water (especially water from the melted ice in the Northern Area)\nHobby: Meditating in a quiet place\nFavorite Vehicle: None\n\nPiccolo is a fictional character from the Dragon Ball metaseries. He is considered both the son and reincarnation of Demon King Piccolo and was spawned to save himself from certain death at the hands of Son Goku. Like his father, he appears as a tall green humanoid creature with pointy ears; he is later revealed to be part of an alien race known as the Namekians.\n\nPiccolo is first consumed with revenge against Goku, and elects to defeat and kill him during the 23rd Budokai Tenkaichi. After his narrow defeat against Goku, Piccolo is soon forced to form an at first uneasy alliance with Goku and his friends against newer, more dangerous threats like the Saiyans and Freeza. Out of necessity he also takes it upon himself to train Goku's child Son Gohan, forming a bond which is strengthened when he sacrifices himself to save the child's life against Nappa. After his resurrection, he fully joins Goku and the others in their struggles against ever more powerful villains.\n\nPiccolo still retains elements of ruthlessness and cockiness, but once he fuses with Kami, all traces of evil and hate disappear, and Piccolo is completely reborn as a pure soul. Piccolo remains a loner, preferring to stand apart from others. He has little to say unless it involves battle, but he normally can still retain his stoic and calm personality in everyday, normal situations. Piccolo has shown to have intelligence, such as when he gathered strength to regenerate his arm after Cell had drained it, or when he elected to kill Babidi since he knew leaving him alive wouldn't solve the problem of Buu. His intelligence is even picked up on Buu, who later absorbs him for his fine brain.\n\nPiccolo's character development entails him changing from a villain hell-bent on revenge on Goku and controlling the world to becoming a better person who is capable of caring about other people, like Gohan and Goku. He's also showed some interest in learning about his Namekian heritage, and has a good affinity with kids, as he trained Gohan for a year, helped Goten and Trunks to learn Fusion\nand is even seen humorously rocking Pan to sleep in Fukkatsu no F. He also acts as a confidant for Dende, who is a younger Namekian and is tasked with watching over Earth (Piccolo is able to impart the wisdom he gained from fusing with Kami, as Kami was the previous placeholder of Dende's current occupation).\n\n(Source: Dragon Ball Super Exciting Guide, Character Edition)"},{"mal_id":20766,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/20766\/Tatsumi_Oga","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/14\/154439.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/14\/154439.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/14\/154439t.webp"}},"name":"Tatsumi Oga","nicknames":["Rampaging Ogre","Child-Rearing Badass","Madason","Bob-Brawler"],"favorites":3002,"about":"Name meaning: Male Deer's Timely Day\nAge: 16\nBirthday: August 31 (Virgo)\nHeight: 179 cm (5' 11'')\nOccupation: High school student, adolescent delinquent\nLikes: Korokke, Dogeza\nDislikes: long stories\nAffiliations: None\n\nTatsumi Oga is the main protagonist in the Beelzebub series, first introduced as a strong fighter, beating up some fellow class mates and then making them bow down to him because they had attacked him in his sleep.

During her first meeting with Taiga, Ami showed her true colors, but the tables were turned when Taiga threw a counterattack back at her. Since then, Ami and Taiga have been enemies, though Ami still sometimes envies Taiga since she can always be honest. It's hinted at, mostly through her childhood friend Yuusaku, that she's like this because she hasn't really known any other life than her modeling, which is part of the reason she moved to their hometown to attend school there.\n\nWhich is why, through her affiliations with Taiga and Ryuuji, Ami eventually develops more of a \"middle ground\" personality, signified with her losing her temper and taking out her frustrations on a stalker fan.

He has a bolt going through his head which turns so his thoughts would be on the matter at hand. He mostly moves by pushing his chair in the direction he wants to go even if it ends up with him crashed on the floor. Stein is such a strong fighter that he could take down Black Star while still seated in his chair. Stein sees everything in the world, including himself, as an experiment or specimen. He even experimented on Spirit (now Death Scythe) when he was sleeping during the five years they worked together. His understanding of soul wavelengths gives him a huge advantage against other users since he can change his own to match the other\u2019s wavelength and thereby nullify or disrupt the soul frequency of the technician and weapon. This comes from his high spiritual flexibility and by observing his opponent beforehand. His soul wavelength is so high that he doesn\u2019t need a weapon and can channel it through his body and release it out of his body as electric discharge. He has a strange hobby of wanting to dissect anything he thinks is interesting. He is also the school doctor; he still respects Spirit and still calls him Senpai.\n\nOther than his electric charges, he uses a repertoire of other techniques such as Soul Sutures, a technique which binds people to e.g. the ground via a soul wavelength (the technique is costly, it requires so much attention the wielder cannot move), Witch Hunter (the technique Maka uses) when he is using Spirit as a weapon, and the ability to cancel out direct soul attacks by matching wavelengths (explained earlier)."},{"mal_id":28522,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/28522\/Shichika_Yasuri","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/99233.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/99233.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/99233t.webp"}},"name":"Shichika Yasuri","nicknames":["Shichirin","Kyotouryuu-chan"],"favorites":2978,"about":"Shichika is the current head of the Kyotou-ryuu style.

She's the first person Tsukune met when he first set foot on the monster realm. Moka's true form is a vampire but she is very sweet and kind. She takes a liking to Tsukune after sucking his blood and seems to get addicted on doing so.\n\nThe reason Moka wears a rosary around her neck is due to her \"inner self.\" When her rosary around her neck is removed (to date Tsukune is the only one capable of removing it), the seal that was keeping her true nature is released. A few physical changes occur, signifying her transformation into a super vampire. Her hair turns silver, her pupils turn to slits, along with a corresponding flash of light. More important than any superficial change, Moka's inner personality rises to the surface. Cold and bloodthirsty, the \"inner\" Moka is actually a completely different entity from the \"outer\" Moka, even going so far as to specifically remind Tsukune to \"be kind to the other Moka.\"\n\nMoka is also one of the most popular girls around the school so she gets a lot of attention around the guys, but she pays them no attention with the exception of Tsukune (much to the guys' dismay). Moka is an excellent student, ranking 13th overall on the school exams, and also a member of the Newspaper Club. Moka is afraid of water, the reason being the purifying powers of water have an adverse effect on Vampires, hurting them as well as rendering them unable to properly function. It's revealed in an omake that she loves tomato juice, but prefers Tsukune's blood.\n\n\n(Source: Rosario to Vampire Wikia)"},{"mal_id":67749,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/67749\/Shin-ah","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/312327.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/312327.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/312327t.webp"}},"name":"Shin-ah","nicknames":["Blue Dragon"],"favorites":2944,"about":"Age: 18\nBirthday: January 3\nHeight: 180 cm\nRace: Dragon\n\nHe is the blue dragon and has dragon eyes that allows him to see great distances.

His bounty before he became a member of the Shichibukai was 340,000,000 Beli.\n\nDoflamingo is a larger than normal blond haired man who generally dresses in flamboyant clothes. In reference to his animal theme, the flamingo, his clothes are brightly colored with his feathered coat being distinctively pink. He also has an odd way of walking, a bow-legged waddle (but does not always do this), which is also a reference to his animal theme. Twenty-two years ago, his hair was longer than currently, had two earrings in his left ear, and he sported a pair of goggles that he wore on his forehead, in addition to his sunglasses that he wears to this day.\n\nHe has a white shirt with red stripes, a green belt, and orange pants with white stripes. Originally in the anime, Doflamingo had a red shirt with black stripes, a purple belt, and black pants with red stripes. However, when he reappeared during the events of Sabaody, his color scheme was switched to its manga depiction with the exception of his glasses. In the manga, he has orange tinted glasses while in the anime, he has purple tinted ones. He is also often, if not always, smiling.\n\nDoflamingo is one of the most carefree characters in One Piece. He seems to have a penchant for dramatic phrasing, as well as a habit of exaggerated posing when giving declarations. He also appears to fear nothing and no one, as he openly taunts Fleet Admiral Sengoku, sits on the table during the Shichibukai meeting and shows only gleeful interest at the thought of warring with Whitebeard. During the Battle of Marineford, all of Doflamingo's interactions have all been for the sake of personal amusement, hinting a sadistic side. He also has an odd habit of sitting in odd positions, like on the back of chairs, on tables, barrels and, even a pile of bodies in the middle of a war zone.\n\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":16211,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/16211\/Gilbert_Nightray","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/308572.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/308572.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/308572t.webp"}},"name":"Gilbert Nightray","nicknames":["Gil","Raven","Seaweed Head"],"favorites":2922,"about":"Age: 24\nBirthday: February 5\nHeight: 182 cm\nBlood type: B\n\nOz's best friend and loyal servant.

He has seven scars on his chest in the shape of the \"Hokuto Shichisei,\" or Big Dipper, that were put there by Shin\n\nA strong and mostly stoic character, Kenshirou is compelled to punish evil-doers and can perform feats not possible for most people. His mastery of the ancient martial art Hokuto Shinken allows him to kill or cripple with a mere touch. The results tend to be very messy -it usually causes parts of the victim to explode- but the art also includes several other means of killing. He can also use this art to heal or to alter people's behavior. Later in the series Kenshirou learns parts of other martial arts.\n\nWhen angry his spiritual powers reach their peak, normally culminating in the dramatic destruction of his shirt and jacket (which, despite the obvious lack of a wardrobe or clothing store, are always replaced in the next episode or story arc) to expose his muscular torso.\n\nHis catchphrase is Omae wa m\u014d shindeiru (\u304a\u307e\u3048\u306f\u3082\u3046\u6b7b\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b), meaning \"You are already dead,\" which he usually says before a villain's head is about to explode.\n\nAfter surviving the nuclear war, he tries to live in peace with his fiancee Yuria, until Jagi instigates Shin, a jealous rival from the Nanto Seiken school, to challenge, then defeat Kenshirou. Shin then engraves the iconic seven scars on Kenshirou's chest and leaves him for dead. Prior to this event he was more forgiving of his enemies, as shown in a flashback of Jagi's failed assassination attempt against him, in which Kenshirou chooses to spare Jagi's life after defeating him rather than end it. When Kenshirou later fights his old rivals in the present, particularly Shin, Jagi, and Raoh, they all remark on Kenshirou's acquired mercilessness.\n\nThe initial story arc centers around Kenshirou's quest to reclaim Yuria from Shin. In the very first chapter, he meets a pair of orphans who follows him in his journey: Bat, a thief; and Lin, a young girl rescued by Ken. Through the course of the series, Kenshirou protects the weak and innocent from the numerous gangs roaming the post-apocalyptic wasteland, eventually gaining his reputation as the \"Savior of the Century's End.\" Kenshirou's skills improve through his encounters with members of the Nanto Roku Seiken and his Hokuto Brothers.\n\nAlthough still emotionally repressed and stoic like most male heroes in 1980's media, Kenshirou is notable in anime culture for being a sensitive and kind-hearted man who broke the then-ironclad \"men don't cry\" cultural expectation. He is famous for openly shedding tears, if not outright weeping for the suffering of innocents and the deaths of his few noble enemies. This trait is unfortunately downplayed in the 1980's anime adaptations, but comes back into the franchise in the adaptations of the 1990s and onward."},{"mal_id":104059,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/104059\/Shuu_Tsukiyama","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/296873.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/296873.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/296873t.webp"}},"name":"Shuu Tsukiyama","nicknames":["Gourmet","MM","Flower Man","Fireworks Man"],"favorites":2430,"about":"Age: 20-21\nBirthday: March 3\nHeight: 180 cm\nWeight: 71 kg\nBlood type: A\nRc Type: Koukaku\nRating: S\nLikes: self-discipline, human tantalizing (young and old alike), a new stimulus\nHobby: sports, martial arts, playing musical instruments, quality criticism of prey\n\nShuu Tsukiyama is the infamous Gourmet ghoul.

She does not remove her hairpins, except to sleep (she is seen without them in episode 64 when she wakes up), as they are worn in memory of her brother, while her hair is worn long in honor of the promise Tatsuki Arisawa once made to protect her. Her large breasts are occasionally made the subject of jokes in the series. She also has an amazingly hard head, which has injured Ury\u016b, Chad, and Ichigo. The only person who has been able to damage her head has been Yachiru Kusajishi in a comical moment when she is riding on Kenpachi Zaraki's shoulders. Orihime has yellow-orange\/brown eyes in colored pictures of the manga, but gray eyes in the anime.\n\nOrihime is friendly, humorous in her own way, sensitive, and kind. She comes off as naive and rather clueless, which is at odds with her exceptionally high marks in school. Apparently, she is hopeless when it comes to technology. One of the members of the Handicrafts' Club remarks that she is not smart enough to use a cell phone, which is why she does not have one. Additionally, according to Tatsuki, Orihime has the fighting skill of a black belt, however, in the English dubbed version she says Orihime is at the skill of a yellow belt.\n\nOrihime cooks and eats strange food at home, although she also likes some normal food. Aside from Rangiku Matsumoto and possibly Tessai Tsukabishi, no one shares Orihime's tastes. Her favorite food is red bean paste, and she likes putting butter on sweet potatoes.\n\nOrihime has a tendency to rush into situations without thinking, sometimes leading to embarrassing consequences. At one point, the schoolgirls ask Rukia if she has feelings for Ichigo. When Rukia denies any such thing, Orihime is disappointed that Rukia does not share her sentiments, because if she had, then it would be two girls against one boy and therefore the girls \"team\" would win, which makes no sense. She also tends to have an overactive imagination and gets carried away thinking of implausible scenarios, such as portraying herself as a futuristic and apparently highly destructive robot in an assignment asking \"How do you see yourself in the future?\", when the question refers to what occupation one wishes or believes they will have.\n\nOrihime has also demonstrated that she is perceptive, mostly when it comes to Ichigo Kurosaki. She is in love with Ichigo, and in both the manga and anime, her feelings only become more evident as time goes on. She has revealed these feelings both to Rangiku Matsumoto and to Ichigo himself, though he was asleep at the time. She also has the uncanny ability to detect Ichigo by scent and sense his spiritual pressure, even when masked by the visored.\n\nOrihime lives by herself in Karakura Town, where the story takes place, and is supported by relatives living elsewhere. Previously, she had lived with her older brother, Sora, who was fifteen years older than her. She and her brother were raised by a drunk father and an unfaithful mother, who always argued and beat their children. It is unknown if her parents are still alive.\n\nWhen Sora turned eighteen, he ran away with Orihime, who was three years old, and raised her since. For six years, Orihime and Sora lived in harmony despite the fact that Orihime was bullied in school because of her long hair. One day, Sora gave Orihime a pair of hairpins. However, Orihime refused to wear them because she said they were childish. On the same day, Sora was wounded in a car accident and died in the Kurosaki clinic. Orihime has worn the hairpins ever since. A year after Sora died, Orihime met Tatsuki who defended her from the bullies. They have been best friends ever since."},{"mal_id":24509,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/24509\/TK","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/91153.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/91153.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/91153t.webp"}},"name":"T.K.","nicknames":[],"favorites":2362,"about":"\"TK\" is a mysterious character.

He is the son of King Solomon and Queen Sheba of Alma Torran, and is commonly referred to as Solomon's proxy. Aladdin was raised by Ugo in the Sacred Place and sent to this world to fight Al-Thamen prevent a repeat of the tragic incident that destroyed Alma Torran.\n\nAs a Magi, Aladdin is very powerful. He can use Magoi and several types of Magic to fight in a battle and can easily overpower strong fighters like Morgiana. It is revealed that he has always known the magic Ugo once used on his hands called Har-Har Infigar. Ugo taught him it just in case, so whenever Ugo used this magic, it was actually Aladdin that supplied the Magoi. He was told in Magnostadt that he is classified as a \"Red Magician,\" one who specializes in flame and heat magic.\n\nAfter his training in Magnostadt, he has become quite skilled using multiple types of magic at once and in combinations. And it is able to use the Wisdom of Solomon.\n\nAladdin has a kind and cheerful personality, and as such he is easily able to make friends. He cherishes friends a lot since he's never really had friends except for Ugo prior to his arrival in the world, and gets upset if people disrespects them or harms them, even holding grudges against those who hurt them. In order to help his friends, he's become dedicated to becoming stronger. Aladdin does everything he can to defend and protect his friends from enemy attack, even to the point of him almost dying due to over-exertion.\n\nHe's a little naive about the world, not knowing what bazaars or Dungeons are because most of his life was spent in the Room of Fortitude. However, he is rather wise for his age, able to offer advice to others and providing remarkable insight at various points of time. Aladdin never seems condescending when criticizing others, and offers his opinions and thoughts in a matter-of-fact manner. He also has a calm temperament, even able to stay level-headed in dangerous or dire situations to think up of plans and solutions. He's also very eager to learn, demonstrating great enthusiasm in learning magic from Yamraiha and in his classes in Magnostadt.\n\nAladdin isn't shown to be a greedy person as demonstrated when he doesn't use his one wish for fortune or eternal life from Ugo and readily offering his whole bag of coins to hitch a ride to Magnostadt. Despite all this, however, he is quite perverted for his age as he likes to grope women with \"large, soft breasts\" and according to Alibaba, has \"manly interests.\"\n\nAladdin also has a tendency to eat food that isn't his, such as when he ate all the watermelons in a cart belonging to Alibaba's master as shown in the anime, and Leila's precious watermelons in the manga. He also harbors a secret feeling of loneliness because he's different from everyone else since he's a magician and since he's different even from the three other Magis, him being the fourth Magi that shouldn't even exist.\n\n(Source: Magi Character Encyclopedia, Magi Official Guidebook, Magi Wikia)"},{"mal_id":539,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/539\/Nausica\u00e4","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/310238.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/310238.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/310238t.webp"}},"name":"Nausica\u00e4","nicknames":[],"favorites":2358,"about":"The Princess of the Valley of Wind.

He proves to be a valuable ally although his and Vash's philosophies often conflict, Wolfwood being a firm believer in martialism while Vash is a pacifist. By the end of the series, he agrees with Vash's way of thinking even though it costs him dearly. Wolfwood's purpose is to raise money for the children in the orphanage he runs.\n\nThe giant cross that he carries comes in two versions. Version 1 holds 12 pistols (across arms of the cross). Version 2 houses a giant machine gun (long part of the cross) and finally, a rocket launcher in the top, while the ammunition is stored in the arms of the cross(an alternate opinion is simply that one of the horizontal arms holds ammo for the machine gun and rocket launcher while the other holds six pistols). The trigger for the Version 2 is a skull shaped symbol in the centre of the cross. As can be expected, the weapon\/case is very heavy, and only Wolfwood, Milly, and Vash seem to have no trouble holding it (though Vash once comments on its weight). The weapon is not actually named in the anime, but it is commonly referred to as Punisher, which comes from the manga. Wolfwood states that it's heavy \"with God's mercy,\" a fitting statement from the cynical Wolfwood.\n\nHe is modeled on Tortoise Matsumoto, the lead singer of the Japanese rock band Ulfuls. The name Wolfwood (\u30a6\u30eb\u30d5\u30a6\u30c3\u30c9 urufuddo) is a corruption of Ulfuls (\u30a6\u30eb\u30d5\u30eb\u30ba urufuruzu), which is in turn a corruption of the English word soulful (\u30bd\u30a6\u30eb\u30d5\u30eb s\u014drufuru).\n\nNightow is frequently asked in interviews and at convention panels what the \"D.\" in Wolfwood's name stands for. His responses have varied each time, ranging from \"Dangerous\" to \"Dokonokuminomonjawaresumakinishiteshizumetarokakora.\" The latter is actually stereotypical yakuza slang, and would be written out as \"\u3069\u3053\u306e\u7d44\u306e\u8005\u3058\u3083\u3001\u308f\u308c\uff01\uff1f\u3000\u7c00\u5dfb\u304d\u306b\u3057\u3066\u6c88\u3081\u305f\u308d\u304b\u3001\u3053\u3089\uff01\", which roughly means \"What the hell family do you think you're from!? I'm gonna tie you up in a reed mat and dunk ya!\". The common theme in these various expansions of the single letter \"D\" is one of destructive force, anger, or violence, which are traits Nightow has modeled the character after.\n\nIn the original Japanese version, Wolfwood speaks in a Kansai Dialect. Nightow has said of this: \"It's an English-speaking world, so he's not actually speaking Kansai dialect. Think of it as indicating some accent.\"\n\n\n(Source: Answers.com, Wikipedia, Nicholas D.

She is an adolescent but very powerful sorceress, with a great love of money, treasure (especially the magical sort) and food. In the anime and manga (but not the light novel) Lina uses overly destructive magic recklessly (but comically), often with little provocation. She is reputed to be an evil, powerful, destructive, diminutive sorceress (the evil part isn't true). She has an older sister, Luna, who is a powerful swordswoman. Although Lina has faced down dragons, monsters, and even Dark Lords with little fear, the mere mention of Luna's name sends her into terrified hysterics. She also suffers from a fear of slugs.\n\nIn the first episode of the TV series, she introduces herself by destroying a gang of bandits known as the Dragon Fangs. She steals a large portion of their treasure, then sets off towards the nearest town to cash it in for a sizable profit. On the way to the town she is ambushed by the remainder of the Dragon Fangs. However, mere seconds before she would have blasted them to bits, Gourry Gabriev valiantly comes to her \"rescue\" and they begin their adventures together. In manga, anime and novels, Lina and Gourry do fall in love, but acting on these feelings is an entirely different story.\n\nLina has many different nicknames, one of them being \"Dragon Spooker\", a name that she isn't too fond of. This is rumored to have appeared because of an incident in the first episode, in which the Leader of the Dragon Fangs\u2019 pet black dragon escapes. Just when it appears that the beast is going to crush Lina (and Gourry, who was knocked out on top of her in a compromising position), it blanches in disgust and steps over her, a blush along its snout, much to her shock, and thereafter rage. However, the nickname was mentioned before the black dragon met her, thus leading to a possible earlier incident.\n\nAnother nickname Lina encounters is the \"Dragon Nester.\" This comes from a rhyme: \"Little girl with little breasts, scares the dragon from its nest.\" This takes off from a running gag, in which characters constantly comment on the small size of Lina's breasts. She generally takes offense to these comments, and often responds with violence. This nickname only appears in the English dub but small breast jokes are a staple of the franchise.\n\nIn Slayers TRY, Gourry, Amelia and Zelgadis find out that Lina has an elder sister named Luna. Luna is a skilled and powerful warrior, who later retired and became a waitress in Lina's hometown. When Lina refused to accompany Filia on her quest, Filia handed Lina a letter from Luna that said, \"Shut up and do it!\", prompting Lina to cower in fear."},{"mal_id":13531,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/13531\/Shouta_Kazehaya","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/76844.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/76844.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/76844t.webp"}},"name":"Shouta Kazehaya","nicknames":[],"favorites":2303,"about":"Age: 17\\n\r\nBirthday: May 15\\n\r\nHeight: 175 cm (5'9\")\\n\r\nWeight: 60 kg (132 lbs.)\\n\r\nBlood type: O\\n\r\nMotto: Believe and pursue the truth.\\n\r\n\\n\r\nKazehaya is Sawako's outgoing and friendly classmate, and is Sawako's sweet and friendly friend.

He is a shark-type Beastman with feline genetics. His appearance is more humanoid than most other Beastmen, except for his cat-like eyes, shark-like teeth, and large clawed paws in place of hands. He is skilled in piloting Gunmen, as well as in unarmed combat. While hunting for food, he attacks Kamina when he found, running into his Gunmen Enki after Yoko intervene in a ensuing fight between the two. He manages to overcome Simon and Kamina's attacks, but leaves before the fight ends. The next day, Viral returns to execute his mission as member of the Human Execution Squad, facing Kamina and Simon again; this time however, Viral is defeated by the newly formed Gurren-Lagann, barraging it missiles in order to conceal his escape, swearing revenge on Kamina for his humiliation when he took Enki's helmet in the fight.\n\nViral later returns alongside Supreme General Thymilph and the Dai-Gunzan to crush Team Gurren with the upgraded Enkidu, but is severely injured in the battle, which resulted in the Dai-Gurren's capture and the death of his superior. He tries to obtain another chance to fight by trying to join Supreme General Adiane's side, in spite of her treating him like garbage as she blames him for Thymilph's demise. Still, Viral saved Adiane from harm during a fight with Team Dai-Gurren, by stopping the Dai-Gurren's foot from crushing her. After Adiane's death by the Dai-Gurren's attack and being the only survivor of the Dai-Gunkai, Viral curses the Gurren-Lagann and swears to bring pain and punishment to those who killed his two superiors and robbing him of a honor.\n\nUnder Supreme General Cytomander's command, Viral took part on the aerial attack on the Dai-Gurren. His battle with the Gurren-Lagann, piloted by Simon and Yoko, extended to the control room of Cytomander's aerial fortress, the Dai-Gunten. There, he learned of Kamina's death, and discovered that he not only lost to a human, but to a child as well, challenging Simon to a one-on-one duel in their mecha. But the battle was interrupted by Cytomander, who took Yoko hostage, and ordered Viral to destroy the defenseless Gurren-Lagann. However, Viral disobeyed as he knew this outcome would not make him regain his lost pride and honor. For this action, Cytomander asked the Spiral King's permission to execute him for treason, but Viral's last request was hearing from the King himself of what is the true nature of human race. Thus, Lord Genome dispenses Cytomander and conducts Viral to a room where he reveals the truth behind the Beastmen's existance before making him immortal. Viral's last effort against the Gurren-Lagann was in the Spiral King's throne room, where he believed he could finally obtain his vengeance after becoming immortal, but was soundly defeated. Lord Genome revealed that the reason he gave Viral immortality was not to fight against Simon, as none without \"Spiral Energy\" could stand against his power, but to make of him as an eternal witness of his triumph against Team Dai-Gurren.\n\n\nViral's name comes directly from the word \"viral,\" tying in with the Beastmen's genetics theme, but there are other theories about his name's origin. One is the fact that it can also be an anagram for \"rival,\" referring to his constant rivalry with Kamina, which transfered to Simon throughout the series until near the end. Another possible theory comes from the Nikopol Trilogy of comic books written by Enki Bilal, as Enki is the name of Viral's first Gunmen and \"Bilal,\" pronounced in Japanese, sounds like \"Viral.\" Supporting this theory is Viral's theme song, which is titled \"Nikopol,\" on the anime's soundtrack.\n\nThe name of Viral's Gunmen may be tied to the Sumerian diety Enki, though it is much more likely that there is a deliberate connection between his second Gunmen, Enkidu, and the character of Enkidu from the Epic of Gilgamesh. The myth consists of Enkidu (\"Enki's creation\"), a man of the wild who seeks to challenge King Gilgamesh, a mighty warrior, but who later befriends him and assists him in in his travels."},{"mal_id":128137,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/128137\/Hajime_Nagumo","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/382159.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/382159.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/12\/382159t.webp"}},"name":"Hajime Nagumo","nicknames":[],"favorites":2244,"about":"Hajime was a complete otaku and always came to class with a sleepy expression.

His main goals are to capture Uchiha Sasuke as his new body to gain possession of the Sharingan and to destroy Konoha.\n\n\n\nFrom his childhood days Orochimaru was identified as a genius shinobi and a once-in-a-generation prodigy. His parents died when he was young and according to Jiraiya, Orochimaru's goals, which were quite alien to the ideals within the village, were associated with these painful memories.\n\nHe was a student of the Third Hokage, who recognized Orochimaru's natural talent and often told Jiraiya to be more like Orochimaru. The Third was aware of a malice and a lust for power within Orochimaru, but chose to pretend not to notice and hoped that he could quell this part of Orochimaru's personality.\n\nOrochimaru's desire for power grew as the years went by. One day while visiting his parents' grave he found the shedded skin of a white snake. As the Third Hokage explained, it was known to represent good forture and luck which inspired Orochimaru. He began to study kinjutsu (forbidden techniques) and became obsessed with learning all ninjutsu that exists in the world.\n\nAfter leaving Konoha, Orochimaru joined an elite criminal organisation called Akatsuki. What he did while he was a member of the organization is pretty much unknown. The only information that was revealed is that his partner was Sasori and he made an attempt to take control of Uchiha Itachi's body to gain the possesion of the Sharingan."},{"mal_id":1896,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/1896\/Fate_Testarossa","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/226585.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/226585.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/226585t.webp"}},"name":"Fate Testarossa","nicknames":["Fate T.

Her real name is Sofiya Pavlovna. She was brought up by her grandfather, the military head of the USSR. Before joining the mafia, Balalaika was a captain in the Soviet Army and a Vozdushno-Desantnye Vojska paratrooper who served in the Soviet war in Afghanistan. A fine marksman and sniper, she was nicknamed \"balalaika\", one of the Soviet Army's slang terms for the Dragunov sniper rifle. Due to Balalaika's leadership during the hellish fighting in Afghanistan, her men look up to her as their superior and will do just about anything upon her orders. As a combat officer, she is a skilled strategist and well-rounded fighter, capable of taking care of herself despite the fact that all of her troopers, including Boris, often worry about her. Although she has shown herself to be rather cynical on occasion, she is also a pragmatic and professional businesswoman. She frequently employs Dutch and the Lagoon Company, apparently because they share a mutual respect.\n\nBalalaika can be easily identified by the burn marks which scar most of the right side of her face, neck, and chest which she suffered in Afghanistan, earning her the nickname \"Fry-Face\" by those who dislike her. She has long blonde hair, and usually wears a military greatcoat, thrown over a low-cut business suit. She smokes cigars, in contrast with the other characters who smoke cigarettes. Based on her service in Afghanistan and the missed opportunity to participate in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, she is between 31\u201335 years old. She is one of the few people to earn Revy's respect. In turn, Balalaika also seems to hold Rock in high regard, sometimes relying on his knowledge and business skills.\n\nIn critical operations, Balalaika calls upon a personal cadre of ex-Soviet airborne troops and Spetsnaz commandos who are Afghanistan veterans. Known as the Desantniki, they act as Hotel Moscow's special ops team. When conducting foreign operations from Thai soil, she uses the Russian cargo ship Maria Zeleska as a legal cover from the police and various law enforcement agencies. In spite of the fact that Balalaika is on the Interpol list, she uses the pseudonym Vladilena N. Vasilinov in Japan, being covered by diplomatic immunity.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia, edited)"},{"mal_id":324,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/324\/Ryouma_Echizen","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/7\/92916.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/7\/92916.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/7\/92916t.webp"}},"name":"Ryouma Echizen","nicknames":["Ochibi","Koshimae","Prince","Chibisuke","Gaki"],"favorites":2142,"about":"1st Year Student\nNicknames: Prince of Tennis, Samurai Jr., Super Rookie of the East, Super Freshman, Seigaku's Pillar of Support, Ochibi (by Kikumaru Eiji), Chibisuke (Ryoga Echizen), Brat (by Akutsu Jin), Koshimae (Kintar\u014d T\u014dyama), Tennis No Oujisama (by Keigo Atobe), Seishonen (by Nanjir\u014d Echizen), Samurai (by Ken)\nBirthdate: December 24\nZodiac: Capricorn\nClass: 1-2\nRelatives: Father- Echizen Nanjiroh; Mother- Echizen Rinko; Halfbrother- Echizen Ryoga; Cousin- Meino Nanako; Cat- Karupin\nPlaystyle: All-rounder\nDominant Hand: Left, Ambidextrous\nHeight: 151cm\nBlood Type: O\nSpecial Moves: Twist Serve, Twist Smash, Drive A, Drive B, Drive C, Drive D, Cool Drive, Cyclone Smash (anime only), Samurai Drive, One-Footed Split Step, Muga no Kyouchi\nHat: Fila\nShirt: Fila\nFavorite Shoes: Fila (Marks Philippoussis Mid)\nFavorite Racket: YonexBRIDGESTONE (DYNABEAM GRANDEA)\nFavorite Subject: Science, English\nWorst Subject: Japanese.\nCommittee: Library Committee \nFavorite Color: Silver\nFavorite Food: Egg sandwiches, Chawanmushi, Fried Fish, Japanese\nHobby: Trying new hot spring bath salts in his bath\nFather's Occupation: Helps run the temple nearby\n\n\nRyoma Echizen (\u8d8a\u524d \u30ea\u30e7\u30fc\u30de, Echizen Ry\u014dma) is the protagonist of the Prince of Tennis series.

Teacher\nWeapon: Delflinger (\u30c7\u30eb\u30d5\u30ea\u30f3\u30ac\u30fc), a sentient sword\n\nSaito Hiraga, the main male character, is from Earth (specifically Tokyo, Japan). At the time of the summoning, he had just picked up his laptop after attempting to get it repaired in Akihabara. A portal of some kind opened in front of him; and Saito's curiosity getting the better of him, he touched it and was sucked through. At first, Saito had no idea where he was, and was thoroughly disoriented. When he arrives on the other side however he is made to sit and obey like a normal household dog. When the bond of him being her familiar, involves having a kiss with the familiar, he is quite shocked at why they do it. In the anime, he also could not identify nor understand the language the students were speaking, but after Louise attempts to cast a silence spell on him that fails, he could understand and communicate with others as though they were speaking Japanese. It is not clear whether he was actually gifted with full knowledge of their language, or whether the misfired spell was similar in principle to a universal translator. This was not the case in the light novel though, where he does understand their language; like the names of the characters, the language spoken by them is also French.\n\nThere are Runes inscribed into Saito's hand as a result of his being bound to Louise. They read geboundolf or Gundolf meaning Gand\u00e1lfr (\u30ac\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30eb\u30f4, Gand\u0101ruvu?). These runes glow when his Gand\u00e1lfr powers activate. As a Gand\u00e1lfr, Saito has the ability to use any object that was made with the intent of being used as a weapon at an extremely high level of skill. He also becomes significantly stronger, faster and tougher. Even weapons that he had never touched before, such as an M-72 rocket launcher and a World War II Zero Fighter, can be instantly understood and utilized. This physical augmentation fades more or less instantly when he stops using the power, which can result in him falling unconscious if he'd been wounded previously. That he can only use items specifically crafted for the purpose of weapons was revealed by Derflinger after a failed attempt to use an ornamental sword. It has not been made clear whether Gand\u00e1lfr powers could be used in conjunction with purely magical weaponry such as a wand or a staff. Even with these abilities he doesn't defend himself at all against Louise's constant beatings.\n\nThe series constantly implies him being a pervert and sometimes he does think exactly like one, but justifiably, he is a young single guy who isn't married to anyone. Louise just enforces an ownership type arrangement over Saito implying she is owed Saito's feelings. It is later revealed that Saito has feelings for Louise and even says it openly to her.\n\nSaito also has a bit of a troublesome and somewhat complicated tendency of getting involved with women. Strange and oddly sexual things happen when he seemingly becomes intimate with another girl. A few examples are when Kirche or even Siesta try to gain his attention, by mostly sexual seduction. When he meets or speaks to an attractive girl, he is often only noticing her chest in a few instances . This is actually one of the main reasons why Louise treats him so poorly as he is expected to be perfect in every way in her childish mindset.\n\nAlthough he acts a bit perverted at times, this does not mean that he does not think of Louise. Similar to how she feels whenever he is becoming intimate with another girl (specifically with large breasts) Saito can get very upset when it comes to Louise and other men. He dislikes Julio for his \"snobbish\" interest in Louise, especially since he is adored by all the other young girls in Tristain Academy. He becomes extremely jealous and calls him a bastard whenever he tries to touch Louise or gain her attention. He also becomes upset he hears of Louise being married off to someone else. When his friends dragged him into a hole to peep at the girls while they were bathing, he was extremely protective of Louise and stopped them before they saw her naked.He uses the name \"My Louise\" several times in the light novels when he feels jealous toward other guys. This is definite evidence of his strong feelings for Louise.\n\nHis partner, the talking sword Derflinger, was also the partner of the Gand\u00e1lfr from six-thousand years ago. His advice and comments never reflect well on Saito. Saito protects Louise because he is her familiar, and it is later shown that he has feelings for her as well, claiming \"All that he is good at is protecting her.\" He is revealed to be a Gand\u00e1lfr, a familiar who exists to protect a Void Wizard as they cast their spells. Even when this fact becomes known to Louise, she still physically assaults him, while Saito is seen often shrugging it off as his fault. Saito was given the nickname \"Our Sword\" by the head cook in episode three, where Louise takes Saito into town to purchase a weapon for him, which happens to be the legendary sword Derflinger. By the beginning of the third series, the magical runes on Saito's hand mysteriously disappear, and Saito's position of Gand\u00e1lfr is in question. He regains them when he is re-summoned by Louise. With the return of runes, Saito is knighted for the feat of stopping an entire army by himself, and given a hero's welcome at the Academy. Saito is named after Gennai Hiraga who is an Edo period Japanese scientist, and his name is written as \"ability man.\""},{"mal_id":22998,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/22998\/Eijun_Sawamura","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/5\/235393.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/5\/235393.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/5\/235393t.webp"}},"name":"Eijun Sawamura","nicknames":["Ei-chan","Bakamura"],"favorites":2066,"about":"School: Akagi Middle School (formerly), Seidou High School (currently)\nAge: 16\nBirthday: 15 May\nBirthplace: Nagano Prefecture\nHeight: 175 cm (5'9\")\nWeight: 65 kg (143 lbs)\nBlood type: O\n\nSawamura Eijun comes from the prefecture of Nagano, where he played baseball for Akagi middle school.

Formerly Sherry of the Black Organization, she is on the run from them and lives with Professor Agasa. She is also one of few characters who knows Shinichi is Conan. \n\nMiyano Shiho and her older sister, Miyano Akemi, were born into the secret crime syndicate \"The Black Organization.\" Her English mother, Miyano Elena, and her Japanese father, Miyano Atsushi, were both scientists working for the Black Organization on an important secret project. While Haibara was young, both her parents died in what was claimed to be an accident. While Akemi lived a normal life, the highly intelligent Haibara was groomed to take over her parents' research. A child prodigy, she was sent to the United States for education at a very young age, and then later came back to Japan to finish her parents' secret project.\n\nShiho was unhappy that the Black Organization's was using the incomplete APTX 4869 for murder, as that was not the drug's intended purpose. When Shiho received word that her sister Akemi had been killed, but was given no explanation why, she decided to boycott her research until the Black Organization gave her an adequate explanation. Instead, the Organization confined her in a small room to await her execution. With no other way out, she took a pill of APTX 4869 to commit suicide, but instead shrank into an eight year old girl. In her new, smaller body, she escaped from the Black Organization and attempted to reach Shinichi's house, hoping he might be able to help her. Exhausted, she collapsed in front of Shinichi's house, where she was found by Professor Agasa, who took her in. In fact, as it turned out later, Agasa was acquaintances with her parents\u2014especially her father\u2014even though he didn't know at that time that they had children or were part of the Black Organization.\n\nTo prevent the knowledge of her transfiguration from being discovered, Shiho and Professor Agasa create her alias Haibara Ai. As Haibara, she attends Teitan Elementary School with Kudou Shinichi's shrunken form, Edogawa Conan. Following her first adventure with the Detective Boys in which they investigate the disappearance of a schoolmate's brother, she reveals her true identity to Conan and the fact that she had developed the APTX 4869. At first stunned, then outraged, Conan protests her presence, but as time passes, he accepts Haibara as a friend and fellow victim, though her cynicism and secretive air still rail him at times. Haibara also joins the ranks of the Detective Boys, and although she does not think too highly of her teammates' immature antics, she has come to value them all as close friends.\n\nHaibara has a calm and cool personality, sarcastic wit, and high intelligence. When freshly escaped from the Black Organization, she was cynical and pushed others away. Haibara has since defrosted by embracing her new child life and has established strong relationships with Conan, the Detective Boys, Agasa, and Ran.\n\nShe tries to keep Conan from doing reckless things that may give away their identity, though often she is surprised by his actions which usually result in gaining the information he needs while also keeping their identities secret. However, whenever Conan is reckless in regards to keeping his identity from Ran, Haibara is the one who plans ahead in order to keep him from being revealed."},{"mal_id":730,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/730\/Kazuma_Kuwabara","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/96678.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/96678.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/96678t.webp"}},"name":"Kazuma Kuwabara","nicknames":["Kuwa-chan","Kazu"],"favorites":2056,"about":"Kuwabara, as most people call him, is the second-toughest kid in Sarayashiki Junior High School and is always trying to usurp Yusuke Urameshi's position as the toughest.

He develops a minor crush on Botan when he first meets her, but later harbors intense feelings on the ice apparition Yukina, but is unaware that she is Hiei's sister.\n\nKuwabara has a tough older sister named Shizuru Kuwabara. She and Yukina are the only characters known to call him by his given name. In the anime, Kazuma and Shizuru's parents never appear and are rarely, if ever, even acknowledged. His father does makes a brief appearance in the final volume of the manga to reveal that Yukina is going to be living with them and appears to be aware of the Reikai, etc. As the show progress, Kuwabara's and Yusuke's relationship evolves from rivals to best friends, although the two still disagree constantly. Kuwabara and Kurama are quite cordial with each other, but Kuwabara shares no love for Hiei, and both will readily mention their hatred of the other, although in truth deep down they are friends. \n\nKuwabara's most unusual ability is his sensitivity to Reiki, or Spirit Awareness. He and his band of friends call this \"the Tickle.\" Kuwabara has the ability to sense when ghosts and the paranormal are around, can see spirits and other demons, and can predict motives of others. Kuwabara can also create a blade out of his own spirit energy (known as the Rei Ken, or Spirit Sword).

During his training, Kuwabara's sword is able to extend and shrink to his whim, and he can even create two, one in each hand.\n\nKuwabara, unlike the rest of his teammates, can be reckless, but is extremely loyal to his friends and has a very strict code of honor.

In the movie, he pilots 00 Qan[T]~-start-25-stop \nHis name could also be denoted to state his personality. Translated it could mean To obtain the moment.\n\nSetsuna is taciturn, introverted, and righteous against war. He believes there are key disturbances that affect the world from coming together in peace and harmony. He labeled specific people and\/or forces as a source of conflict towards the world's path to peace. He has little tolerance for diplomats and politicians, believing that their negotiations only prolong wars and cause more strife (due to personal experience). He's got a vendetta to settle and his past battle experiences stirs old bitter feelings, increasing his combat potential as a beneficial side effect. Though a self proclaimed atheist, he often questions the motivations of God with people and worldly events. He idolizes the Gundams so much that he wants to embody Exia as himself, a Gundam. He's a traditionalist in honor and a martyr for his cause in Celestial Being. \n\nIn a letter to Marina Ismail, he revealed more in depth into his feelings and thinking. Setsuna wanted to understand the lesser aspects of humanity. He wanted to know why the world is filled with people with innate dark intentions and inconsiderate of other people's suffering. He wanted to find these answers with his Gundam in hopes to bring mutual understanding and peace.\n \nAfter a 5 year hiatus, Setsuna has taken an unofficial role as the leader of the Gundam Meisters. He's now able to assert and express his feelings to people without reservation. Setsuna's ideals are still the same, but his recent experiences lead him to believe the importance of self change and the need to fight for a better future. His determination and strong self confidence motivates and inspires people around him. He's more understanding and compromising, but also capable making hard-but necessary-decisions that would lead people to dislike him. He has no problems making life defining decisions for other people when they can't make the choice and would kill if necessary. \n\nSetsuna is skilled in many ways of war. Trained by Ali Al-Saachez at a young age, Setsuna already knew how to work with a wide range of firearms, close-quarter-combat, use of explosives, infiltration, and other areas of guerrilla warfare by the age of 10. As Celestial Being's Gundam Meister, he uses his former combat training in his KPSA days to reflect Exia's combat style. He's been trained by Celestial Being to know limited MS technical skills to maintain and repair his Gundam. His 5 year hiatus with Celestial Being didn't dull his piloting skills at all, his MS combat capabilities were refined as his MS CQC skills and aiming showed improvement.\n\n\nSkills &amp; Capabilities\nSetsuna is skilled in many ways of war and fighting.

He's been trained by CB to know some MS technical skills to maintain and repair his Gundam.\nHis 4 year hiatus (AD 2312 - Season 2) with Celestial Being didn't dull his MS piloting skills at all, his MS combat capabilities were refined as his MS CQC skills and aiming showed great improvement. Due to the power of 00 Gundam's concentrated GN particles with Trans-Am Raiser, Setsuna's brain has been gradually enhanced to utilize quantum brainwaves. He's able to sense quantum brainwaves (QBWs) near him and track users of QBWs. Eventually, he naturally evolves into humanity's first true\/genuine Innovator.\n\nSetsuna's Innovator capabilities aren't completely defined as he's the first naturally evolved Innovator. It has yet to be revealed if he can communicate with Veda or Celestial Being technology like the Innovades can. He can anticipate movements and actions of his opponents and sense impending danger from far distances. As an Innovator, he has heightened reflexes, a longer lifespan than normal humans, and can communicate his thoughts via quantum brainwaves.\n\nAfter Setsuna joined the ELS, his body is not entirely human. The ELS reformed his body based on their bio-technology, forever retaining his youthful appearance with a metallic shine.

Her chest is seen at the top of the transparent suit as well as revealing her belly.\n\nOrigami is a person that rarely openly talks with other people unless needed with only a few exceptions such as Shidou Itsuka and Tooka Yatogami. She isn't a shy person, but more of an unsocial type of person. She can be a bit reckless or aggressive if she has a goal or purpose to fulfill.\n\n\nAs a wizard, She was the vanguard and current \"Ace\" for the AST. Her skills as a member of the AST were noted to be quite phenomenal, as she was the only one who at first could manage to fight a spirit close quarters(although she still lost), and she was also the most extreme, hoping to kill Yoshino by first dropping a building on her dome. She managed to utilise the CR-Unit &lt;White Licorice&gt;, which is noted to be very dangerous and dificult to handle, in fact, no one else but her has proven to be capable of using it long enough to actually put it to practical use. She was even able to land a hit on the world's most powerful Wizard, Ellen, which Ellen herself considers worthy of praise.\n\n\nOrigami one-sidedly proclaims herself as Shidou's girlfriend or lover unbeknownst to Shidouu himself. Origami uses any chance she gets to make her relationship with Shidou more intimate. Her love for him is quite unhealthy as she often disregards most of Shidou's feelings or opinions and can come off as self-centered.\n\nIn reality, Origami is a stalker with Shidou being the focus of her desires. She has secretly been following Shidou around in his everyday life since before the start of the series and has on many occasions tried seducing him with her actions, such as buying a new bed, making herself deliberately vulnerable, giving him a combination of strong energy drinks and preparing traps to entice him to her. However blunt she may be, Shidou has not acknowledged or reciprocated her feelings.\n\nOrigami has also proven to value Shidou's life over her loyalty to AST and DEM, going so far as to steal a dangerous CR-Unit from them and combat them specifically to protect him. She however, does not seem to value his emotions above her revenge, as while she does try to remove him physically from her fights with Kotori and the other spirits, she makes no attempt to stop or even consider his reaction to her killing them. This is especially evident in regards to Kotori, since she is Shidou's sister, while Origami later admitted she didn't want to kill Kotori, and readily believed Shidou when he said that it was a different spirit that killed her parents, it is clear that had Shidou not told her that then she would have without regret.\n\nOrigami sees Tooka as an enemy, love rival, and an annoying \"baka\" that gets in her way with Shidou. Origami shows little respect for her as the quarrel between them as Spirit and AST member remains unsettled despite the fact that Tooka's powers are sealed. Origami does not trust her very much as she views every other Spirit but is not hostile to her due to Tooka's currently sealed status.\n\n\n(Source: Date A Live Wikia)"},{"mal_id":171969,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/171969\/Takemichi_Hanagaki","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/397761.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/397761.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/8\/397761t.webp"}},"name":"Takemichi Hanagaki","nicknames":[],"favorites":1947,"about":"Takemichi is a 26-year-old unemployed guy who learns that the girl he dated in middle school\u2014the only girl he ever dated\u2014has died.

The title of Brunestud was given to those True Ancestors capable of manifesting the Millennium Castle Brunestud, and has been likened to be the vampire royal family, although this is not strictly true. The True Ancestors were a race of beings copied from TYPE-MOON, the ultimate being of the moon, also known as the Crimson Moon. Long ago the planet had no defense mechanism against humanity, nothing to keep them in check. Thus the Crimson Moon came down and offered to help the planet make a race of ultimate beings to rule over humanity, thus resulting in them being the 'consciousness of the planet.' True Ancestors are likened to occurrences such as earthquakes and typhoons rather than individuals as their \"...actions, while evil and without justification, would come as naturally to her (Arcueid and other True Ancestors) as breathing.\" However the race was fundamentally flawed, they had a desire to drink blood that the original, the Crimson Moon had. The True Ancestors needed to use a large portion of their power to suppress this impulse, but as there was no cure, and with passage of time the impulse grew, more and more True Ancestors fell and began drinking blood indiscriminately, while others most likely went into eternal sleep.\nThe True Ancestors didn't have a specific reason in creating Arcueid. They normally only mold new True Ancestors to fit specific needs. There was no need for a being as strong as her, but in the end, she originated from nothingness, simply as a product to realize the pointless goal of \"the strongest True Ancestor.\"[2] They used her great strength to make her into a weapon, the executioner of the fallen True Ancestors and of the most powerful Dead Apostles. According to Ciel, this happened in the 12th century AD, when the number of fallen True Ancestors was very high. She was able to perform this duty splendidly, but she was nothing more than a tool. She was taught nothing beyond what she needed to know to hunt her targets, to the extent that she even ignored the fact that she was the same kind of creature as those she was supposed to destroy, and went to sleep after every kill, with her accumulated memories erased.\n\nAs the executioner, she did not have any vampiric impulses, and the rest of the True Ancestors also believed she had none. A priest from the church seeking perfect immortality, Michael Roa Valdamjong, needed to become a Dead Apostle to continue his research as he had already reached the potential of his human body. Arcueid, ignorant of her nature as a vampire and the consequences of drinking blood, was easily tricked by Roa into drinking his and turned berserk, wiping out most of the True Ancestors, turning Roa into one of the strongest Dead Apostles and having a considerable portion of her power stolen by him, before she managed to regain her sanity long enough to chain herself to the throne and go to sleep. From then on she had to suppress her urge to drink blood like any other True Ancestors. The rest of the True Ancestors were wiped out either by Roa or the rest of the Dead Apostles, who made a game of trying to assassinate their creators.\n\nArcueid finally managed to destroy Roa's original body, although it took an alliance with the Burial Agency to do it. Roa was not killed however, as he had managed to master reincarnation, and constantly reincarnated into host bodies he chose before his deaths. These host bodies were chosen for a mix of social standing (rich families with influence) and the physical\/magical potential of the body. After destroying Roa's original body, Arcueid went to sleep and awoke only to kill Roa's re-incarnations constantly, but was never able to destroy him and get her power back as he would simply re-incarnate each time. At the time of Tsukihime, Roa had re-incarnated 17 times, with his last re-incarnation being Tohno SHIKI.\n\n(Source: Type-Moon Wiki)"},{"mal_id":20326,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/20326\/Yutaka_Hoshino","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/266673.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/266673.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/266673t.webp"}},"name":"Yutaka Hoshino","nicknames":["Peco"],"favorites":1901,"about":"Peco is a member of the Katase High table tennis club, along with his best friend Smile.

He wears a straw hat and a pink flowered haori over his captain's uniform. Although his haori and obi sash are cheap, his pinwheel hairpin is very expensive. In his off time, he can be seen drinking sake and napping. Other times, he likes to chase after women, which is noted by Yasochika Iemura of the 4th Squad when commenting in his diary. In particular, he often flirts with his lieutenant, Nanao Ise, whom he calls 'my Nanao-chan' (little Nanao). In one of the omake outtakes he told Rangiku Matsumoto to buy Nanao Ise a sexy outfit while in the human world. Matsumoto brings back a skimpy two piece bathing suit which Nanao refuses to try on. He is close friends with 13th Division Captain Jushiro Ukitake, with whom he graduated from the shinigami academy and works with often.\n\nKyoraku tends to use a more familiar speech style than most other characters in Bleach. He generally refers to his fellow captains and shinigami by their first name followed by an honorific, and is the only character who dispenses with honorifics when addressing General Yamamoto, calling him old Yama (Yama-j\u012b). Even Ukitake, who was also taught by Yamamoto, does not do this.\n\nKyoraku is a peace-loving man who will always try to talk his way out of a fight. However, he does not wish to insult his opponents by not fighting, either, as he explains to Chad. Since he has achieved the rank of captain, it is implied that he must be a powerful fighter, but the true extent of his abilities has not been seen in the series. General Yamamoto states that Kyoraku and Jushiro Ukitake, both of whom he trained himself, possess \"greater powers on the battlefield than any younger generation, or old,\" suggesting that the two are more powerful than any other captains, with the possible exception of Yamamoto himself.\n\nThe slightly eccentric Kyoraku also seems to like making an impression on opponents. In the Soul Society arc, when Kyoraku confronts Chad who had invaded the 8th division area, he has Nanao Ise scatter rose petals over him to make a dramatic entrance. It creates this effect at first, but when Nanao doesn't stop dropping the petals and Kyoraku begins to exhort her to stop in an embarrassing manner, she dumps the whole basket on him, burying him and ruining his entrance.\n\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":31418,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/31418\/Nyaruko","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/2\/217623.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/2\/217623.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/2\/217623t.webp"}},"name":"Nyaruko","nicknames":["Nyarlathotep","Nyarlko"],"favorites":1897,"about":"A Nyarlotephian, who has come to Earth on a mission to protect Mahiro.

Physically, Jet is very tall with a muscular build. He wears a beard with no mustache, and is completely bald save for the back of his head. Spike acts lazy and uninterested, whereas Jet is hard working and a jack-of-all-trades. Jet was once an investigator in the Inter Solar System Police (ISSP) for many years until he lost his arm in an investigation that went awry when his corrupt partner (and friend at the time) betrayed him. His arm was replaced with a cybernetic limb (later revealed to be by choice, as biological replacements were possible, he wanted the fake arm as a reminder of what happened), yet his loss of limb coupled with the general corruption of the police force prompted Jet to quit the ISSP in disgust and become a freelance bounty hunter. Jet also considers himself something of a renaissance man: he cultivates bonsai trees, cooks, enjoys jazz\/blues music (he named his ship the Bebop, referring to a type of jazz), especially Charlie Parker, and even has interest in Goethe. As a character, Jet is the quintessential oyaji or \"dad\" even though he often wishes people would view him as a more brotherly figure (so as not to seem old).\n\nJet is skilled with handguns, typically carrying a pre-2004 Walther P99, as well as the use of the netgun. He is good with hand to hand combat as well. Unlike Spike, Jet tends to use more raw muscle than technique. He is also a great mechanic and pilot. Aside from the converted interplanetary fishing trawler vessel Bebop, Jet flies a smaller ship called Hammerhead. The Hammerhead appears to be a modified (Jet added larger engines and fuel tanks) salvage-craft that uses a mechanical arm equipped with a harpoon as its main weapon, which is somewhat analogous to his own mechanical arm. Both the Hammerhead and the Bebop are able to land on water, and have a fishing theme, most likely because Ganymede's surface is mostly covered with water (it is later revealed that the Bebop was originally a fishing ship that Jet \"customized\" with larger engines).\n\nDuring the series, it is revealed that Jet once lived with a woman named Alisa, who left him because he was too controlling. Later they meet up again when Alisa's new boyfriend Rhint is wanted for murder. Jet then ends up in a situation somewhat similar to that of Vicious, where he must hunt down a woman who broke his heart, and her lover."},{"mal_id":35872,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/35872\/Akari_Akaza","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/319182.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/319182.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/319182t.webp"}},"name":"Akari Akaza","nicknames":["Akarin"],"favorites":1867,"about":"Age: 13\nBirthday: July 24\nBlood type: A\n\nAkari is a polite red-haired girl who is supposedly the main protagonist of the series.

Her desire to win the Alice Game is the strongest of all the dolls, and is primarily driven by her wish to gain the attention of \"Father\" (Rozen). Sadistic, spiteful, and arrogant (all due to her spectacular Superiority complex), Suigintou has no inhibitions when it comes to the Alice Game. She will use any method available to her, regardless of how brutal they may be, to grasp victory. Although she generally avoids associating with the other dolls on a social level, she has a particularly strong hate for Shinku. This hate borders on obsession, as she can approximate how many hours and minutes since they have last met. However, upon meeting Megu, her medium, Suigintou's attitude and motivations begin to shift; she begins to feel a strong affection for someone other than \"Father\". Suigintou's desire to protect Megu begins to even overpower her wish to meet him: she hopes to use the collected Rosa Mystica to heal Megu of her heart ailment, rather than become Alice.\n\nSuigintou has a number of unique traits and flaws amongst the seven Rozen Maiden. In the anime, she is missing her torso; Shinku explains at one point that before Suigintou was completed, her design was erased, but gives no further explanation as to why or how. Curiously, after Suigintou is destroyed in battle by Shinku partly she is restored mid-way through Rozen Maiden Tr\u00e4umend. The identity of the person responsible for her restoration is never revealed. In the Rozen Maiden Tr\u00e4umend finale, she tells Shinku that \"Father\" had told her that even with her flawed body, she was also entitled to a part in the Alice Game. Later, Rozen is seen lovingly fixing her neck ribbon as she is unconscious. He even grips gently around the waist afterwards, implying that he has mended her incomplete body.\n\n\n\nAlong with her artificial spirit, Meimei, Suigintou's weapons are her ragged black wings. With their arrow-like feathers, she can conjure up a shield, a large sword, or even twin black dragons. Suigintou can also create destructive blue flames as a last resort in battle.

I'm not Yoshinon. I'm Yoshino. Yoshinon is my best friend.\"\n\nYoshino is a spirit and an important character in Date A Live series. She is the second Spirit saved by Shido. Yoshino is a shy girl who is said to be the Kindest spirit up to date. Her codename is Hermit.\n\nWhen Yoshino first appeared in the series, it was also when she first encountered Shidou. To Shidou, Yoshino appeared to be a lost child wandering around in the rain. The next time they met, Yoshino fell under attack from the AST and ran away. The third time they met was when Shidou made the decision to save Yoshino from herself and from the AST for he discovered that Yoshino was an extremely kind child even towards the people who were hunting and attacking her.\n\nAfter having most of her power sealed by Shidou, Yoshino started living in one of Ratatoskr's living quarters on Fraxinus temporarily before she moved down to the apartment complex next to Shidou's home. Yoshino is currently practicing with the help from Ratatoskr how to speak for herself, or to be more precise, how to speak without the aid of Yoshinon.\n\nYoshino has the appearance of a young girl, at about 13 to 14 years of age, with blue eyes and hair, wearing a light-blue short dress and outside, wearing a large green raincoat with a pair of rabbit-ear hood, holding a rabbit puppet, Yoshinon, in her left hand. The raincoat seems to have a tail with a pink ribbon attaching to it. Her preferred form of clothing appears to be sundresses along with boots that match her raincoat.\n\nAfter her spirit power was sealed, the dress under her raincoat is the one she is wearing now, adding a hat with a ribbon attach to it and still holding Yoshinon, her puppet. Yoshinon is a mischievous white rabbit puppet that Yoshino always holds in her left hand. Yoshinon's right eye has a black button with a brown band that resembles a eyepatch, while its left eye is a very small pink dot.\n\nAt her first appearance, Yoshino is a very shy girl, unable to articulate full sentences and express herself well. Other than Yoshino, she has her other personality named Yoshinon which is the rabbit in her left arm. Yoshino says it's her hero for protecting her from bad guys (which are the ASTs). It is also said that Yoshino created Yoshinon in order to restrain herself from hurting humans. As she lets Yoshinon do the talking for her with its outgoing personality. She improves after Shidou seals her powers and begins learning to integrate herself into society. Later in the story, most of the time Yoshino will force herself to speak personally while conversing with Shidou, instead of using her puppet Yoshinon.\n\nYoshino has the ability to manipulate all states of water (solid, liquid, and gas) in her surrounding area. She usually uses her powers for defensive purposes only due to her kind and shy nature.\n\nHer Angel, Zadkiel, is a huge puppet that resembles Yoshinon. Zadkiel has two forms, the first form resembles Yoshinon but is a lot bigger, with one red round eye and an eyepatch, large sharp teeth, and white skin. In this form, Zadkiel has the ability to absorb water from the ground and air and release it in the form of an attack. Yoshinon is also able to talk through the puppet, and acts as a limiter to suppress the Angel's powers so that it doesn't end up killing anyone. Zadkiel's second form appears to be its true form, this form also resembles Yoshinon but is even larger than when Yoshinon becomes Zadkiel. The second form is larger than a many-story building, and does not have an eyepatch. This Zadkiel has the same powers as the other but is a lot more powerful. Even Yoshino has problems controlling the Angel.\n\nWhen using Sirion, Yoshino fuses with Zadkiel, gaining an ice armour over her Astral Dress. Her powers over water and ice increased to the point of the surrounding area being frozen. Shido remarked that she looked like she was wearing Zadkiel.\n\nBeing a passive Spirit, Yoshino prefers to take non-aggressive actions such as running and hiding as opposed to engaging in combat against her enemies. Yoshino's Astral Dress is named El, and has enough defensive power to block an AST missile barrage.\n\n(Source: Date A Live Wiki)"},{"mal_id":1709,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/1709\/Eureka","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/109619.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/109619.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/13\/109619t.webp"}},"name":"Eureka","nicknames":[],"favorites":1853,"about":"Age: About 14-16\n\nEureka is a pale young girl with turquoise hair and lavender eyes and is a pilot of the Nirvash typeZERO.

The man lives a double life: his \"white side\" that is a carefree and goofy man of Portuguese descent who travels with humans that love to play poker, and his sadistic \"dark side\" that has a lust for blood and takes up his role as Noah's descendant (and therefore, one of the antagonists).\n\nTyki and his group suckers Arystar into a game of strip poker, winning literally all his assets, but Allen interferes and plays against them. He wins (with cheating learned from years spent with Cross), and Tyki gives him a pack of playing cards before his group departs.\n\nThe author gives the first hint that something is wrong when the group is revealed to have in their possession a chunk of silver with the name Kevin Yeegar on it - the name of the exorcist general that had recently been killed. In their next encounter, Allen meets Tyki's Noah side, and, after a talk, Tyki leaves him to die from a heart wound inflicted by Tease (a flesh-eating type of golem in the form of a butterfly) after destroying his Innocence, spreading out the same cards he had given Allen over the boy's body. After realizing that Allen's name would not come off the walls of the jail cell, he goes with Jasdero and Debit to find Cross.\n\nTyki's powers stem from his ability to selectively interact with his surroundings. This allows him to become effectively intangible, passing through all manner of matter as a ghost would, or walk on air.\n\nHis powers also have an offensive aspect, allowing him to phase his hand into his opponents' bodies and selectively interact with their organs (i.e. heart), crushing them or tearing them out without leaving any external wounds.\nHe also possesses the ability to reject the existence of space around an area he chooses, which essentially makes it possible for him to create a vacuum around anything he pleases (this ability was put to good effect against Allen, which allowed Tyki to suffocate him in their fight).\n\nHe usually attacks using his powers in concert with the flesh-eating Tease golems given to him by the Earl of Millennium. The Tease themselves are capable of multiplying themselves, becoming a large swarm to consume Tyki's enemies, or change shape to act as shields or throwing blades.\nHe was responsible for the death of Kevin Yeegar, one of the 5 exorcist generals, and has killed over 6 other exorcists himself, including Suman Dark (whom Allen had tried to save), Tina Spark, Gwen Frere, Sol Galen, Kazanna Reed, Chakar Rabon, and Daisya Barry."},{"mal_id":88577,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/88577\/Fremy_Speeddraw","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/214653.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/214653.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/214653t.webp"}},"name":"Fremy Speeddraw","nicknames":["The Six Flower Killer"],"favorites":1762,"about":"Fremy has the appearance of a frail girl with white skin and white hair, an eye patch covering her right eye, a leather cape as well as leather clothes, and a black cloth covering her forehead.

As such, she's also the only Saint who isn't under the supervision of Mora. Her power allows her to freely create explosives during battles, and greatly increases the damage caused by her gun's bullets.

Riko named him Regu after a dog she used to have.\n\nRegu's body is extremely durable and resistant to physical damage, and is much lighter than its size would suggest. His arms can be extended to be 40 meters in length, and each of them has a built-in Incinerator relic. These high-powered beam cannons are capable of reducing to ashes almost anything; however, his Incinerator is a weapon of last resort as even a single shot depletes the body's energy almost completely, which in turn makes Regu lose consciousness for 2 hours ten minutes after its use. Having an artificial body, Regu may be the one of the only intelligent beings completely immune to the Curse of the Abyss. Because of this, he is sometimes referred to as an \"Aubade,\" or, the \"Treasure of the Deep.\"\n\nDespite being a formidable fighter, Regu is rather shy and unassertive. He blushes easily and often cries when in distress. Unlike Riko, Regu becomes easily flustered when in danger, and must often rely on Riko's judgment in difficult situations.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia, edited)"},{"mal_id":37302,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/37302\/Ayase_Aragaki","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/117839.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/117839.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/10\/117839t.webp"}},"name":"Ayase Aragaki","nicknames":[],"favorites":1745,"about":"Age: 14-15\nBirthday: July 26th\nZodiac: Leo\nBlood Type: A\nHeight: 166 cm\nWeight: 44 kg\nMeasurements: 80\/56\/83\n\nAyase is Kirino's friend and classmate who works as a model alongside her and is also her best friend.

He now wears the same ring as Sasori, having recovered it after Sasori's death, and took his place as Deidara's partner. Unlike the majority of ninja thus far, Tobi has not been shown wearing a visible forehead protector, so his place of origin is unknown. He wears an orange mask with single eye-hole covered in a swirl pattern concentrated towards the right eye. This odd mask that covers his entire face save for his right eye. Furthermore, Tobi has several bolts or pins present on the arms of his uniform, now obscured by his Akatsuki cloak.\n\nTobi's area of expertise remains unclear, as he has never been shown fighting. He and Deidara have defeated the three-tailed beast, but Tobi is never shown doing anything but running from it. After the battle, which goes largely unwitnessed, Tobi claims to have knocked it out with a single attack. Deidara disagrees with the assessment, claiming that it was his \"artistic contribution\" (exploding clay) that allowed them to win. During his fight with Sasuke, Tobi shows the ability to recover from what are presumably debilitating or fatal blows. After being slashed across the midsection by Sasuke's sword, Tobi collapses, only to stand up again a few seconds later and complain about the speed of the attack. Aside from this, Tobi has yet to demonstrate any techniques.\n\nTobi has a very formal and correct manner of speech. While his physical appearance remains a mystery, Zetsu has implied that he is relatively young when one side of him referred to Tobi as a \"good boy.\" He respects Deidara, referring to him as Deidara-senpai. Tobi's personality is rather odd in comparison with other Akatsuki members. While most of the members are dedicated and serious, though somewhat argumentative or even hostile towards each other when not fighting, Tobi is more carefree and goofy, much like Naruto. His personality does not please Deidara, who believes that all Akatsuki members should be serious and calm. Tobi unintentionally irritates Deidara frequently, which usually results in Deidara attacking Tobi in a comedic fashion."},{"mal_id":155273,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/155273\/Pingu","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/3\/341111.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/3\/341111.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/3\/341111t.webp"}},"name":"Pingu","nicknames":[],"favorites":1644,"about":"The main protagonist of Pingu and its revival, Pingu in the City.

Kenichi was frequently treated as a friendless loser at the beginning of the series, however it all changed when he met Furinji Miu. After the fateful meeting, he decided to stand for himself and be truly strong; or at least, strong enough to protect those who are dear to him. Though he's constantly considered cowardly at the beginning of the series, he shows that when his loved ones lives are on the line, he's actually much braver than he appears.\n\n\n\nOn his way to school one day Kenichi met Miu once again (though he did not recognize her) and the two soon became friends. Kenichi was a member of the school's karate club but was forced to do menial chores and was used as a punching bag until one day he stood up to a hulking student who tried to force him to quit and the two agreed to a match in which the loser will be forced to quit the club. With Miu's help he managed to win but quit the club anyway and drew unwanted attention from the club's president whom he fought twice managing an easy win the second time due to training he received at the Ryozanpaku dojo. However the trouble does not end for Kenichi as the club president had ties to a rising delinquent group known as Ragnarok who begin to take an interest in Kenichi. The manga follows Kenichi as he continues to train at, and eventually live at the Ryozanpaku dojo as well as facing increasingly more powerful foes.\n\nThough it is consistently stated that Kenichi has no talent for martial arts he more than makes up for it with his work ethic. It is due to this and the abnormally intense training regime he is forced to endure that Kenichi has gone from being considered the weakest student in his high school to being able to fight and defeat opponents with many years worth of skill as well as some with borderline superhuman abilities.\n\nKenichi is kind, compassionate, thoughtful, and moral to a fault. He is against violence and only studies martial arts to protect others, and also adheres to a strict code of morals and refuses to kill or hit women even if it means death. In spite of his strong moral standards however Kenichi can be quite perverted as he will jump at the chance to see Miu or Shigure bathing and also buys pictures of them from Ma (though these pictures are mostly fakes). He also adopted a \"fighting style\" from Ma called \"ecchi mode\" in which he attempts to grope women which strangely enough has actually helped him get out of a jam before. As a result of his kindness Kenichi has made many friends some of whom are former enemies and has even managed to unknowingly win the affections of Ma Renka and Li Raichi.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)"},{"mal_id":33117,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/33117\/Ryner_Lute","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/235589.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/235589.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/4\/235589t.webp"}},"name":"Ryner Lute","nicknames":[],"favorites":1549,"about":"Frequently appearing to be lethargic, sleepy, and unmotivated, Ryner is the protagonist of the story. He has brown eyes and hair and is of slender build; is naturally talented in magic, hand-to-hand combat, arts of assassination, ancient lore, languages and symbols, and the bearer of Alpha Stigma, an ocular ability which grants him the ability to analyze various forms of magic. Alpha Stigma bearers when activating their powers, have a pentagram with reddish hue appearing over their pupils. Because of this ability, in a world where magic forms differs from country to country and is a closely guarded secret, he has learned and acquired magic originating from different countries through battles with their mages. Although the Alpha Stigma are the weakest and most common type out of the five types of \"Cursed Eyes,\" primarily because the bearers don't live to adulthood to fully utilize their potential before they are slain after going berserk usually at a young age, Ryner's eyes are no ordinary Alpha Stigma.\n\n\n\nRyner has a tendency to distance himself from others because he does not wish to cause harm and grief to others due to his eyes and vice versa. He has caused multiple girls throughout his life to fall in love with him, though he is reluctant to love again after his first love sacrificed herself to save him. That's what he thought until he met Ferris, whom he began to have strong feelings for and with whom he formed a strong bond.\n\nUndertaking a quest from his trusted friend and the new King of Roland, Sion, and in the company of swordswoman Ferris, he travels across the continent of Menoris in search of the \"Relics of Heroes,\" legendary artifacts later more accurately and collectively known as \"Rule Fragment\" and \"Rule Phajeel\"The undertaking was a result of his own research report into the \"Relics of Heroes\", with the vision of creating a world with no wars and conflicts.

He eventually unravels a series of conspiracy throughout Roland and its neighboring countries, and discovers a greater force at work.

Little is known about the strange, large foreigner who has been with Motoko Kusanagi for years.  He was once American and served in the Special Forces in South America.  His amount of cyborg-ization is variable according to the storyline, from his limbs only up to most of his body, second only to the Major herself.  Despite the availability of superior eyes, he grew superstitious about his old-style eye replacements, popular with many high-level military operatives.  He also retains some residual body-image issues, causing him to continually purchase workout equipment despite the obvious anachronism.\n\nIn the two Stand Alone Complex series, Batou's personality is more like that in the manga version. He is an outgoing joker, but one with a quick temper. Being emotional and not as calm as the Major, Batou shows anger at injustice and cruelty, to the point of seeming downright hotheaded at times. He sometimes shows impatience with Section 9's rookies, such as Togusa, to the point of rudeness, and jokes with him constantly.\n\nAt times, he is also shown to be a voice of reason and concern for the Major, to the point that she admits she can confide in him. Both seasons of the anime, like the movies, hint at some romantic tension between the two, particularly near the end of each Gig. This tension is touched upon, briefly, in the Solid State Society movie, where Batou admits that he's been covering up any of the Major's appearances in cases prior to the Puppet Master case.\n\nBatou had served in a military special forces team before entering Section 9. Most of his body is comprised of cybernetic prosthetics. Despite the fact that exercise will do his cybernetic body parts no benefits, Batou lifts weights as a hobby. Based on several of the Stand Alone Complex episodes, Batou seems to have served in the Japanese Ground Self Defense Force at some point before he joined Section 9. It is suggested several times that he held a JGSDF Ranger qualification. His unit was involved in World War IV and was deployed to South America alongside Motoko Kusanagi, where they accidentally stumbled across an American Imperial Navy unit conducting a covert operation codenamed \"Project Sunset,\" which consisted of soldiers earning the trust of communities and then carrying out war crimes, spreading terror and chaos in the enemy ranks. Batou's eyes are grey and clearly prosthetic. They are standard cybernetic equipment issued to Ranger Special Forces operatives."},{"mal_id":14503,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/character\/14503\/Souichi_Negishi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/33487.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/33487.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/characters\/9\/33487t.webp"}},"name":"Souichi Negishi","nicknames":["Johannes Krauser II","Krauser-san"],"favorites":1541,"about":"The main protagonist.

During production, everyone played their roles in order to complete the project. However, it is revealed that Aoi is not the greatest at drawing, computer graphics, script writing, or voice acting. Before graduation, the girls made a promise to reunite one day and create another anime altogether. They set this creed in stone by sharing donuts. It seems that everyone has their minds set on what they want to pursue in the anime industry. As for Aoi, she graduated without a specific goal in mind, and came to Musashino Animation to work as a production assistant, immediately getting involved in her first anime, Exodus!\n\nAfter her first year as a production assistant at Musashino Animation, the company is hired to work on an anime adaptation for a manga titled \"The Third Girl Aerials Squad.\" At this time, Aoi is promoted by director Seiichi Kinoshita to her new position as Head Production Assistant after her colleague, Yutaka Honda, resigned from the company to pursue his dreams. This deals a great amount of pressure on Aoi, as she is immediately overwhelmed by the tasks involved in her position.\n\nAoi seems to have a bright and cheerful personality and she always strives to stay positive, no matter how murky the problem. She is also hardworking and cares a lot for her friends and always tries to stay calm in stressful situations, and she is also a very energetic girl.\n\nAlthough a fresh face at Musashino Animation, she quickly learns how to cope with the everyday stresses of her job. Her diligence and determination to find a solution to every predicament has garnered the respect of many of her colleagues and acquaintances in the industry, alike.

He is introduced to ATs by Noyamano family, whom he lives with due to his parents' deaths. He eventually forms Kogarasumaru, and takes on the Trophaeum. Ikki is often characterized as a crow due to a small crow, K\u016b, using his hair as a nest.\n\n\nIkki is a very upbeat, zany person, who seemingly is as eccentric as just about everyone else in the universe of Air Gear. He delights in eating meat, a privilege he is often deprived of in the Noyamano household by his sisters. He is rash, impulsive, and determined to do everything his way, whether for good or bad. In battle he either comes off as his odinary crazy and unpredictable personality, or his more serious, cold and steely side, which other characters has described as a rare occurrence, and as an intimidating scene. Ikki is totally hooked onto Air Trekking. He treats his ATs with care to such a standard that even his sisters feel jealous of, and his mind is constantly on Air Trekking; for example, during the Kyoto trip he fails to notice Ringo's affection initially, deadset on figuring out a 'Windmill Theory' that another Storm Rider has revealed to him as the secret behind the Rumble King. Ikki is a self-proclaimed genius and very proud of himself, in particular his fighting abilities. In truth he works very hard behind the other's back, as is revealed when Kuu brings his friends to his secret training area, where the scars left over by his training could be seen in chapter 87.\n\nThough his attitude can be described as a lowlife, suitable for his gangster-like persona, and though he likes to go around doing insanely foolish things all the time, Ikki has a tendency to think beyond others' perceivable concept and at several intervals can spout deep philosophy that more often than not will impact others. One such incident was the Pomtemkin brothers' battle, where Ikki's plan caused an initial falling out among the Kogarasumaru, where in fact he had his own solution around that matter. Ikki, though easy to miss the obvious, can be very adept when it comes to spotting small details. In their first Parts War, he alone had noticed that Kazu's ATs were the most worn out among them, a mark of how much he practiced.\n\nHe is noticed to be developing a new skill, as Kururu noticed that his AT was worn out. The day came for the Sleeping Forest and the Genesis to fight, Ringo went to the place where Ikki and his gang stayed and revealed her true feelings for Ikki while dressed as Croissant Mask. He was shocked and realizes that he is an idiot for not noticing Ringo's love. Ikki thinks deeply and even in their battle he can't concentrate and then he realizes that Ringo was always there for him. In recent chapters, it's revealed that the trick Ikki was developing was called \"Null Wind\". It combines the power of all the major riders of Kogarasumaru and creates a storm of wind around Ikki, that stops all wing road riders tricks. With this, Ikki is able to win his battle against Sleipnir.\n\n=Tricks= \nSpinning Wallride Overhang 1800\u00b0: \nUPPER SOUL 23Roll: \nMethod Air to Spin That Grab Moonride: \nBackward Cross Ridefall Upper Fang: \"TWINCAM\": \nRoof Gap To Disaster One Foot \"Air line\": \nPile Tornado: Relies on the \"Vacuum Welding\" skill to produce the effects of Tornadogenesis, funneling the air to such consistency that Ikki's kick produces a violently tornado.

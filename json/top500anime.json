However, following feudal Japan's surrender to powerful aliens known as the \"Amanto,\" those aspirations now seem unachievable. With the once-influential shogunate rebuilt as a puppet government, a new law is passed that promptly prohibits all swords in public.

As the founder of Yorozuya, a small business for odd jobs, Gintoki often embarks on endeavors to help other people\u2014though usually in rather strange and unforeseen ways. Assisted by Shinpachi Shimura, a boy with glasses supposedly learning the way of the samurai; Kagura, a tomboyish girl with superhuman strength and an endless appetite; and Sadaharu, their giant pet dog who loves biting on people's heads, the Yorozuya encounter anything from alien royalty to scuffles with local gangs in the ever-changing world of Edo.

Well-balanced with high density action and light-hearted comedy, Cowboy Bebop is a space Western classic and an homage to the smooth and improvised music it is named after. [Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"When Cowboy Bebop first aired in spring of 1998 on TV Tokyo, only episodes 2, 3, 7-15, and 18 were broadcast, it was concluded with a recap special known as Yose Atsume Blues. This was due to anime censorship having increased following the big controversies over Evangelion, as a result most of the series was pulled from the air due to violent content. Satellite channel WOWOW picked up the series in the fall of that year and aired it in its entirety uncensored. Cowboy Bebop was not a ratings hit in Japan, but sold over 19,000 DVD units in the initial release run, and 81,000 overall. Protagonist Spike Spiegel won Best Male Character, and Megumi Hayashibara won Best Voice Actor for her role as Faye Valentine in the 1999 and 2000 Anime Grand Prix, respectively. Cowboy Bebop's biggest influence has been in the United States, where it premiered on Adult Swim in 2001 with many reruns since. The show's heavy Western influence struck a chord with American viewers, where it became a \"gateway drug\" to anime aimed at adult audiences.","season":"spring","year":1998,"broadcast":{"day":"Saturdays","time":"01:00","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Saturdays at 01:00 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/23\/Bandai_Visual"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/102\/Funimation"},{"mal_id":233,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/233\/Bandai_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":14,"type":"anime","name":"Sunrise","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/14\/Sunrise"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":29,"type":"anime","name":"Space","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/29\/Space"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":33095,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/33095\/Shouwa_Genroku_Rakugo_Shinjuu__Sukeroku_Futatabi-hen","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/82947.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/82947t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/82947l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/82947.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/82947t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/82947l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"wxFCi-ybQ5k","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wxFCi-ybQ5k","embed_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/wxFCi-ybQ5k?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/wxFCi-ybQ5k\/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/wxFCi-ybQ5k\/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/wxFCi-ybQ5k\/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/wxFCi-ybQ5k\/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/wxFCi-ybQ5k\/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"title":"Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu: Sukeroku Futatabi-hen","title_english":"Descending Stories: Showa Genroku Rakugo Shinju","title_japanese":"\u662d\u548c\u5143\u7984\u843d\u8a9e\u5fc3\u4e2d\uff5e\u52a9\u516d\u518d\u3073\u7bc7\uff5e","title_synonyms":["Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu 2nd Season","Showa and Genroku Era Lover's Suicide Through Rakugo 2nd Season"],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2017-01-07T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2017-03-25T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":7,"month":1,"year":2017},"to":{"day":25,"month":3,"year":2017}},"string":"Jan 7, 2017 to Mar 25, 2017"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":8.75,"scored_by":55378,"rank":38,"popularity":1124,"members":163970,"favorites":2832,"synopsis":"Even after having risen to the utmost rank of shun'ichi, Yotarou struggles to find his own identity in the world of rakugo.

The travelling Mushishi, Ginko, persists in trying to set right the strange and unsettling situations he encounters. Time loops, living shadows, and telepathy are among the overt effects of interference from Mushi, but more subtle symptoms that take years to be noticed also rouse Ginko's concern as he passes from village to village. Through circumstance, Ginko has become an arbiter, determining which Mushi are blessings and which are curses. But the lines that he seeks to draw are subjective. Some of his patients would rather exercise their new powers until they are utterly consumed by them; others desperately strive to rid themselves of afflictions which are in fact protecting their lives from devastation. Those who cross paths with Mushi must learn to accept seemingly impossible consequences for their actions, and heal wounds they did not know they had.

However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal Titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.

In addition, content from later novels is briefly included in the anime as well. Unlike the novels however, which follow a mostly linear narrative per book, the anime adopts a non-linear storytelling style; the tale of each novel is told simultaneously with one another, with the focus jumping back and forth in time between and within the different plotlines.","season":"summer","year":2007,"broadcast":{"day":"Fridays","time":"00:30","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Fridays at 00:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":17,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/17\/Aniplex"},{"mal_id":765,"type":"anime","name":"Sakura Create","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/765\/Sakura_Create"},{"mal_id":787,"type":"anime","name":"Happinet Pictures","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/787\/Happinet_Pictures"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/102\/Funimation"},{"mal_id":493,"type":"anime","name":"Aniplex of America","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/493\/Aniplex_of_America"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":112,"type":"anime","name":"Brain's Base","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/112\/Brains_Base"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":7,"type":"anime","name":"Mystery","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/7\/Mystery"},{"mal_id":37,"type":"anime","name":"Supernatural","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/37\/Supernatural"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":22789,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/22789\/Barakamon","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1426\/111248.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1426\/111248t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1426\/111248l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1426\/111248.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1426\/111248t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1426\/111248l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"u1pCw1Cr3_U","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=u1pCw1Cr3_U","embed_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/u1pCw1Cr3_U?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/u1pCw1Cr3_U\/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/u1pCw1Cr3_U\/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/u1pCw1Cr3_U\/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/u1pCw1Cr3_U\/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/u1pCw1Cr3_U\/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"title":"Barakamon","title_english":"Barakamon","title_japanese":"\u3070\u3089\u304b\u3082\u3093","title_synonyms":["Barakamon"],"type":"TV","source":"Web manga","episodes":12,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2014-07-06T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2014-09-28T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":6,"month":7,"year":2014},"to":{"day":28,"month":9,"year":2014}},"string":"Jul 6, 2014 to Sep 28, 2014"},"duration":"22 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":8.39,"scored_by":296120,"rank":168,"popularity":273,"members":580008,"favorites":11651,"synopsis":"Seishuu Handa is an up-and-coming calligrapher: young, handsome, talented, and unfortunately, a narcissist to boot.

In the 22nd century, Japan enforces the Sibyl System, an objective means of determining the threat level of each citizen by examining their mental state for signs of criminal intent, known as their Psycho-Pass. Inspectors uphold the law by subjugating, often with lethal force, anyone harboring the slightest ill-will; alongside them are Enforcers, jaded Inspectors that have become latent criminals, granted relative freedom in exchange for carrying out the Inspectors' dirty work. Into this world steps Akane Tsunemori, a young woman with an honest desire to uphold justice. However, as she works alongside veteran Enforcer Shinya Kougami, she soon learns that the Sibyl System's judgments are not as perfect as her fellow Inspectors assume. With everything she has known turned on its head, Akane wrestles with the question of what justice truly is, and whether it can be upheld through the use of a system that may already be corrupt.

Mankind is unable to defend themselves against the Angels despite utilizing their most advanced munitions and military tactics. The only hope for human salvation rests in the hands of NERV, a mysterious organization led by the cold Gendou Ikari. NERV operates giant humanoid robots dubbed \"Evangelions\" to combat the Angels with state-of-the-art advanced weaponry and protective barriers known as Absolute Terror Fields. Years after being abandoned by his father, Shinji Ikari, Gendou's 14-year-old son, returns to Tokyo-3. Shinji undergoes a perpetual internal battle against the deeply buried trauma caused by the loss of his mother and the emotional neglect he suffered at the hands of his father. Terrified to open himself up to another, Shinji's life is forever changed upon meeting 29-year-old Misato Katsuragi, a high-ranking NERV officer who shows him a free-spirited maternal kindness he has never experienced. A devastating Angel attack forces Shinji into action as Gendou reveals his true motive for inviting his son back to Tokyo-3: Shinji is the only child capable of efficiently piloting Evangelion Unit-01, a new robot that synchronizes with his biometrics. Despite the brutal psychological trauma brought about by piloting an Evangelion, Shinji defends Tokyo-3 against the angelic threat, oblivious to his father's dark machinations. [Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Director Hideaki Anno's depression is what led to the dark themes of Neon Genesis Evangelion. Budgetary problems and parental complaints about content led to the original ending being scrapped and replaced with an extremely limited-animation ending breaking from the main plot. A movie, End of Evangelion, was later made based in part on the original planned ending and in part on Anno's increasing frustration with the otaku fanbase. The series' mix of psychoanalysis, religious symbolism, and genre deconstruction proved extremely influential on mature anime in the late '90s onward. The Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006 ranked it as the most popular anime of all time.","season":"fall","year":1995,"broadcast":{"day":"Wednesdays","time":"18:30","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Wednesdays at 18:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":16,"type":"anime","name":"TV Tokyo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/16\/TV_Tokyo"},{"mal_id":113,"type":"anime","name":"Kadokawa Shoten","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/113\/Kadokawa_Shoten"},{"mal_id":139,"type":"anime","name":"Nihon Ad Systems","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/139\/Nihon_Ad_Systems"},{"mal_id":1461,"type":"anime","name":"Audio Tanaka","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1461\/Audio_Tanaka"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":97,"type":"anime","name":"ADV Films","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/97\/ADV_Films"},{"mal_id":783,"type":"anime","name":"GKIDS","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/783\/GKIDS"},{"mal_id":1977,"type":"anime","name":"Netflix","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1977\/Netflix"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":6,"type":"anime","name":"Gainax","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/6\/Gainax"},{"mal_id":103,"type":"anime","name":"Tatsunoko Production","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/103\/Tatsunoko_Production"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":5,"type":"anime","name":"Avant Garde","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/5\/Avant_Garde"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/18\/Mecha"},{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/40\/Psychological"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":9617,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/9617\/K-On_Movie","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/76233.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/76233t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/76233l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/76233.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/76233t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/76233l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"f-_BPUz-Rxs","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=f-_BPUz-Rxs","embed_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/f-_BPUz-Rxs?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/f-_BPUz-Rxs\/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/f-_BPUz-Rxs\/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/f-_BPUz-Rxs\/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/f-_BPUz-Rxs\/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/f-_BPUz-Rxs\/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"title":"K-On!

For nine-year-old Ren, the last person who treated him with any form of kindness has been killed and he is shunned by what is left of his family. With no parents, no real family, and no place to go, Ren escapes into the confusing streets and alleyways of Shibuya. Through the twists and turns of the alleys, Ren stumbles into the intimidating Kumatetsu, who leads him to the beast realm of Shibuten. For Kumatetsu, the boy represents a chance for him to become a candidate to replace the Lord of the realm once he retires. While nearly unmatched in combat, Kumatetsu's chilly persona leaves him with no disciples to teach and no way to prove he is worthy of becoming the Lord's successor. While the two share different goals, they agree to help each other in order to reach them. Kumatetsu searches for recognition; Ren, now known as Kyuuta, searches for the home he never had. As the years pass by, it starts to become apparent that the two are helping each other in more ways than they had originally thought.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Mamoru Oshii's Ghost in the Shell was the first film to adapt Masumane Shirow's manga of the same name. It heavily condenses the original storyline, reducing the original material's comic relief and sexual content in favor of a more serious tone and changing the setting from Japan to a city modelled after Hong Kong. The artwork within the animated film was produced using an innovative mix of cel animation and digital effects. Ghost in the Shell is one of the world's most famous Japanese animated films, being the first to reach #1 on Billboard magazine's video best-seller list, and also served as a major inspiration for the Wachowskis in their creation of the Matrix movies.

Hidden in this secluded mountain retreat is a thousand years of history condensed into one lifetime, waiting to be narrated. Chiyoko's recollections take them on an illusionary journey through Japanese cinematic history that transcends the boundaries of reality; the saga of her acting career intertwines with her filmography, the actors in her life blend seamlessly with the characters on screen, and the present melds with the past. Though the actress may have retired at the height of her career 30 years ago, the curtain on her life's stage has yet to fall.

Yet as years go by and the villagers become more self-sufficient, Holo, who stylizes herself as the \"Wise Wolf of Yoitsu,\" has been reduced to a mere folk tale. When a traveling merchant named Kraft Lawrence stops at Pasloe, Holo offers to become his business partner if he eventually takes her to her northern home of Yoitsu. The savvy trader recognizes Holo's unusual ability to evaluate a person's character and accepts her proposition. Now in the possession of both sharp business skills and a charismatic negotiator, Lawrence inches closer to his goal of opening his own shop. However, as Lawrence travels the countryside with Holo in search of economic opportunities, he begins to realize that his aspirations are slowly morphing into something unexpected. Based on the popular light novel of the same name, Ookami to Koushinryou, also known as Spice and Wolf, fuses the two polar genres of economics and romance to create an enthralling story abundant with elaborate schemes, sharp humor, and witty dialogue. Ookami to Koushinryou is more than just a story of bartering; it turns into a journey of searching for a lost identity in an ever-changing world.

Together, they wish to destroy everything rotten about their current world and create a new, fair society for all. To accomplish their goal, they must commit criminal acts, which the great detective Sherlock Holmes and his partner, John H. Watson, cannot abide by.

The initial Geneon Entertainment USA (then known as Pioneer) releases on VHS and DVD (singles, Signature Series, and box set) used only the first opening on each episode. This was due to the Japanese licensor providing them clean materials for only the first opening to put the English credits on. Geneon later fixed this mistake on their Limited Edition tin releases in 2005\/2006, as well as on the Remix singles. Following Geneon USA's demise in late 2007, the show went out of print. When FUNimation Entertainment picked up the show in 2010 and released it, they repeated Geneon's mistake of using only the first opening on every episode. This mistake was later fixed in 2013 on the Anime Classics re-release.","season":"spring","year":1998,"broadcast":{"day":"Thursdays","time":"01:15","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Thursdays at 01:15 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":123,"type":"anime","name":"Victor Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/123\/Victor_Entertainment"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":102,"type":"anime","name":"Funimation","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/102\/Funimation"},{"mal_id":1459,"type":"anime","name":"Geneon Entertainment USA","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1459\/Geneon_Entertainment_USA"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":11,"type":"anime","name":"Madhouse","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/11\/Madhouse"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":35466,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/35466\/ReLIFE__Kanketsu-hen","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1566\/91061.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1566\/91061t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1566\/91061l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1566\/91061.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1566\/91061t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1566\/91061l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"fM3xoYACtGE","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fM3xoYACtGE","embed_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/fM3xoYACtGE?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/fM3xoYACtGE\/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/fM3xoYACtGE\/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/fM3xoYACtGE\/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/fM3xoYACtGE\/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/fM3xoYACtGE\/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"title":"ReLIFE: Kanketsu-hen","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"ReLIFE \u5b8c\u7d50\u7de8","title_synonyms":["ReLIFE Final Arc"],"type":"Special","source":"Web manga","episodes":4,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2018-03-21T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":21,"month":3,"year":2018},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Mar 21, 2018"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":8.21,"scored_by":185028,"rank":306,"popularity":568,"members":311754,"favorites":1424,"synopsis":"After reliving the life of a high school student through the ReLIFE experiment, 27-year-old Arata Kaizaki cannot believe how quickly it has changed him.

Although their relationship blossoms, Liz must make a heart-wrenching decision in order to truly realize her love for Blue Bird. High school seniors and close friends Mizore Yoroizuka and Nozomi Kasaki are tasked to play the lead instruments in the third movement of Liz and the Blue Bird, a concert band piece inspired by this fairy tale. The introverted and reserved Mizore plays the oboe, representing the kind and gentle Liz. Meanwhile, the radiant and popular Nozomi plays the flute, portraying the cheerful and energetic Blue Bird. However, as they rehearse, the distance between Mizore and Nozomi seems to grow. Their disjointed duet disappoints the band, and with graduation on the horizon, uncertainty about the future spurs complicated emotions. With little time to improve as their performance draws near, they desperately attempt to connect with their respective characters. But when Mizore and Nozomi consider the story from a brand-new perspective, will the girls find the strength to face harsh realities? A spin-off film adaptation of the Hibike Euphonium! series, Liz to Aoi Tori dances between the parallels of a charming fairy tale, a moving musical piece, and a delicate high school friendship.

Always having her nose in a sketchbook, Asakusa draws detailed landscapes and backgrounds of both the world around her and the one within her boundless imagination. Even the simple act of doodling on a wall evolves into an emergency repair on the outer hull of her spaceship. She is only brought back to reality by her best friend Sayaka Kanamori. The pair are stark opposites, with Asakusa's childlike wonder contrasted by Kanamori's calculated approach to life. After a chance encounter where the two \"save\" the young model Tsubame Misuzaki from her overprotective bodyguard, a connection instantly sparks between Asakusa and Misuzaki, as both share an intense passion for art and animation. Whereas Asakusa is interested in backgrounds and settings, Misuzaki loves drawing the human form. Sensing a money-making opportunity, Kanamori suggests that they start an animation club, which they disguise as a motion picture club since the school already has an anime club. Thus begins the trio's journey of producing animation that will awe the world. From the brilliant mind of Masaaki Yuasa, Eizouken ni wa Te wo Dasu na! is a love letter to animation, wildly creative in its approach, and a testament to the potential of the medium.

It is possible for memories to be viewed, altered, and transferred between bodies. These memory chips are used by the rich to obtain eternal lives in carefully selected bodies, while for the poor, selling their own bodies and conserving their souls in the chips often become the only way to earn a living. An electrolytic cloud in the sky serves as a barrier between the heavens of the fortunate and the underworld of the destitute, making this social division impregnable. One day, a man named Kaiba wakes up in an empty room with no memories, a mysterious hole in his chest, and a locket holding the picture of an unknown woman. After escaping an attack and stumbling upon a decrepit village of underworld residents, he begins his adventure across the different planets of this strange universe to find out more about his own identity and the woman he once knew. Through a journey of self-discovery and acceptance, Kaiba weaves together tales of souls and spirits and explores the importance of memories.

With his supreme alchemy skills, Edward binds Alphonse's soul to a large suit of armor. A year later, Edward, now promoted to the fullmetal alchemist of the state, embarks on a journey with his younger brother to obtain the Philosopher's Stone. The fabled mythical object is rumored to be capable of amplifying an alchemist's abilities by leaps and bounds, thus allowing them to override the fundamental law of alchemy: to gain something, an alchemist must sacrifice something of equal value. Edward hopes to draw into the military's resources to find the fabled stone and restore his and Alphonse's bodies to normal. However, the Elric brothers soon discover that there is more to the legendary stone than meets the eye, as they are led to the epicenter of a far darker battle than they could have ever imagined.

For Yajirou, it is restoring his former shapeshifting abilities, whilst little Yashirou is content with continuing his work at the family\u2019s factory.

Like most of Miyazaki's films, it was the top-grossing movie of its release year, earning $113 million in the domestic box office in 2013. The film was controversial on both sides of the political spectrum because of its sympathetic portrayal of Horikoshi and its perceived anti-war stance. The film was nominated for an Academy Award, Miyazaki's third nomination. The film has won several awards. In 2013 it won the Best Animated Feature during the Alliance of Women Film Journalists, during the New York Film Critics Online, during the Online Film Critics Society, during the San Francisco Film Critics Circle and during the Toronto Film Critics Association. Also in 2013 it won the Best Animated Film during the Boston Online Film Critics Association (which tied with Frozen), during the Boston Society of Film Critics, during the Chicago Film Critics Association, during the New York Film Critics Circle and during the San Diego Film Critics Society. During the same year it won the Audience Favorite \u2013 Animation during the Mill Valley Film Festival and the Best Family Film during the Women Film Critics Circle. In 2014 it won the Animation of the Year during the Japan Academy Prize, the Best Animated Film during the National Board of Review and the Best Motion Picture, Animated or Mixed Media during the Satellite Awards.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":1585,"type":"anime","name":"Nichion","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/1585\/Nichion"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":417,"type":"anime","name":"Walt Disney Studios","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/417\/Walt_Disney_Studios"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":21,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Ghibli","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/21\/Studio_Ghibli"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":302,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/302\/Mirai_Shounen_Conan","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/6\/17529.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/6\/17529t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/6\/17529l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/6\/17529.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/6\/17529t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/6\/17529l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"title":"Mirai Shounen Conan","title_english":"Future Boy Conan","title_japanese":"\u672a\u6765\u5c11\u5e74\u30b3\u30ca\u30f3","title_synonyms":["The Boy in Future"],"type":"TV","source":"Novel","episodes":26,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1978-04-04T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1978-10-31T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":4,"month":4,"year":1978},"to":{"day":31,"month":10,"year":1978}},"string":"Apr 4, 1978 to Oct 31, 1978"},"duration":"29 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":8.09,"scored_by":13609,"rank":443,"popularity":2821,"members":41734,"favorites":488,"synopsis":"Conan was the only child born on Remnant Island, a place settled by a group of refugees while they fled a terrifying wave of magnetic bombs that wiped out most of humanity.

After apologizing for her violent reflexes, she introduces herself as Miu Furinji and asks Kenichi to be her friend. Later that day, after karate club practice, Kenichi is given an ultimatum by one of the other club members: they will fight next week and the loser has to quit the club permanently.

Elsewhere, a client request reaches Touko Aozaki's detective agency, tasking Shiki Ryougi with either capturing or killing the perpetrator of last night's incident. But soon, word spreads that a single survivor escaped the slaughter, and now the murderer is plowing down everything in their path to locate and exterminate him. A brutal race against time begins, pitting Shiki against a dangerous foe imperceptible even to her legendary eyes.
